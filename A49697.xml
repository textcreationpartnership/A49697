            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> that <hi>Satan</hi> doth oft <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of light;</hi> and the Evangeliſts, that he had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence

<note place="margin">Mat. 24.24.</note> as to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (if it were poſſible) even the very Elect?</hi> What ſadneſs muſt it needs work in our hearts, to ſee men ſleight and loath the ſpiritual Manna of Gods publick Ordinances, and to long for fleſh of their own fancying; if the Apoſtle had not told us, that the time would come,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.3.</note>

               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.1.</note> And withal, that being thus <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned,</hi> we might endeavour to <hi>arm</hi> our ſelves againſt theſe trials. It is the duty of all men, like the good <hi>Beraeans,</hi> to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17.11.</note> and find out the deceits of ſeducers. And thoſe eſpecially whom God hath made <hi>watchmen</hi> over his people,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 3.17.</note> ought to give all diligence in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering theſe enemies, that would gladly find an opportunity, <hi>to ſow theſe Tares, while we are ſleeping:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13.25.</note> To ſettle, as much as may be, them that ſtand faſt; to reclaim (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) them that are gone aſtray; and to <hi>clear our ſelves from the blood of all men.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This ſmall Tract is deſigned for
<pb facs="tcp:41777:5"/>the promoting of theſe Ends, which I hope may ſtir up others of better abilities and leaſure, to go further in ſo neceſſary a work.

Beſide, if Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s learned books <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> and that later Work of the noble <hi>Du Pleſſis De veritate Chriſt. Relig.</hi> be accounted both excellent and uſeful: then why may not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame nature, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth them, though not <hi>paſſibus aequis,</hi> be eſteemed acceptable, and uſeful in theſe giddy times,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.5.</note> wherein <hi>all the foundations of the Earth are out of courſe?</hi> And as for the ſtile, it is ſuch as is both ſutable to my own Genius, and I hope to the ſubject here handled: And being deſigned chiefly for the benefit of ignorant
<pb facs="tcp:41777:5"/>and miſguided people: <hi>I</hi> thought it better to uſe ſuch a language as might profit them, then ſuch as might amuſe them. However,

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41777:9"/>as one Member of our Body doth beſtir it ſelf in miniſtring to the neceſſities of another.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that fancy that there was a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inclination in the Superiour and Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Faculties of the ſouls of our firſt Parents from their Creation, and that it is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Nature of man as conſiſting of ſoul and body: (From whence they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a Conflict to have been in the ſoul of man between theſe different Motions, as did diſpoſe him to forſake his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs): Theſe I ſay, might be better adviſed, if they did duly conſider what is meant by Gods making man <hi>after his own Image.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> For as the <hi>ſupream Being and firſt Cauſe</hi> of all things is in his meaſure, that is infinitely and unconceivably, perfect in all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Works, and amongſt other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, ſo perfect in Knowledg and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.2.</note> that he is ſaid to <hi>cover himſelf with Light as with a Garment,</hi> and to be ſuch <hi>a Light, that in him is no Darkneſs at all.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 1.5.</note> Even ſo by mans being made after the Image of his Maker, we are to underſtand that in his meaſure, and according to his capacity, he was perfect in all thoſe Excellencies that did appertain to his Nature. And as the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is one of the nobleſt, and the leader of the other Faculties of mans ſoul, we muſt therefore conceive that to be made perfect in Knowledg, ſo far as to be capable of rightly underſtanding whatſoever was neceſſary or ſuitable to the Nature of man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41777:10"/>to know: That this Light was pure and free from being mixed with any darkneſs of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or Error. And that the Will and Affections were perfectly ſubjected to the dominion of the Underſtanding, ſo that they did then as readily obey and execute its Dictates, as the Members of our Body do now move themſelves at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Will.</p>
                     <p>Nor are we to imagine that in this eſtate of perfect holineſs and happineſs in which man was placed, there was any ſuch drawing downward of the ſenſitive Appetite, as might either diſturb the peace of the ſoul by the contrariety of its motion to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reaſon, or elſe diſpoſe and incline man to ſwerve from the right way. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as we believe the Saints in Heaven, when their bodies ſhall be re-united to their ſouls, to be <hi>made perfect in holineſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.23.</note> and nothing to remain in them, that may tend either to diſturb the perfection of their happineſs, or to draw them away from ſerving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying him that is the chiefeſt good. So we may moſt reaſonably believe that in mans firſt Creation, there was no manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or error in his Underſtanding, nor any diſcording motions ariſing from the union of the ſoul and body; nor yet any clouds ariſing from the ſenſitive Appetite, to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the light of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>And whereas there are ſome that conceive the Fall of man to have been occaſioned by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41777:10"/>his <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> that, being of a Finite, though perfect underſtanding, he did not therefore apprehend or conſider all things at once: And therefore fixing his mind wholly upon the pleaſantneſs of the Fruit, ſo as not at the ſame time duly to conſider the ſtrictneſs of Gods command, and the threatning that was annexed to it, he did hereby come to violate <hi>Gods precept</hi> by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing that <hi>pleaſant fruit.</hi> Neither doth this evince any ſhortneſs of ſight, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ignorance or error to have been in man from his Creation: For if he did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all thoſe things together which he ought to have conſidered, yet had he power and capacity ſufficient to have apprehended all things <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be conſidered at once; for elſe we ſhould lay a fault upon the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Wiſdom of God in the Creation of man, if we believe him to have permitted ſuch a defect in his Nature as muſt needs occaſion his ſinning: The default therefore is to be imputed to mans want of putting in execution that power which God had given him. Man fell, not becauſe he wanted knowledg enough to hold him upright, but becauſe <hi>he did not put forth that power</hi> which his Creator had given him to apprehend the ſtrictneſs of his Law, and the certainty of the inflicting the penalty that was annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in caſe of mans diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been ſpoken we may be put in mind to reflect with ſadneſs of heart,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41777:11"/>upon that happineſs which once our Nature did enjoy.
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.29.</note> Thus <hi>God made man upright, but he ſought out many inventions.</hi> And how art thou fallen from Heaven, O thou that waſt made <hi>but little lower than the Angels?</hi> How unlike is man now to that Exquiſite piece which our Creator ſent forth of his hands perfect in beauty? Now the courſe of Nature is inverted, and as all things in mans ſoul were once governed with ſingular order and harmony, ſo now there is as great diſcord and diſorder in all our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.20.</note> 
                        <hi>to call good evil, and evil good.</hi> Or if they cannot prevail to do this, they then riſe up like unruly Subjects againſt the commands of their Sovereign, and ſhake off that yoke of obedience which God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath laid upon them, as in thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent perſons, who do with <hi>Medea</hi> in the Poet, <hi>Videre meliora &amp; probare,</hi> but <hi>dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riora ſequi.</hi> Nor hath the Underſtanding it ſelf (though freer from corruption than the other faculties) wholly eſcaped without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation, but partly through a dimneſs and ſhort-ſightedneſs in it ſelf, is ſubject to Ignorance and Error; and partly through the ill neighbourhood of a depraved Will and diſordered Affections, it is wofully
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41777:11"/>ſwerved from its original Rectitude and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
                     <p>The wonderful Wiſdom and Power of God is manifeſt in making ſuch variety of <hi>Features</hi> in mens <hi>Faces,</hi> that amongſt the many myriads of men that live upon the face of the Earch, there are not any two ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly alike but they are to be diſtinguiſhed by him that looks heedfully upon them. And the ſad and, wonderful miſchief of ſin is as manifeſt in that it hath begotten as much <hi>variety in mens minds,</hi> as is in their Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies; ſo that you can hardly meet with two men ſo exactly of one mind, that you will need to lay a thread upon them to know them apart. <hi>From the beginning</hi> doubtleſs <hi>it was not ſo.</hi> For, as the God of Truth is but one, and there is but one way of Truth; we may believe, that God who made the mind of man on purpoſe to apprehend the Truth, did not put ſuch various tempers into mens minds at firſt, as might make them to have ſuch different thoughts of the ſame thing, of which ſome muſt needs be falſe: For, <hi>Cujus contrarium verum eſt,</hi> &amp;c. contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the ſame object, cannot both be true.</p>
                     <p>Now if Truth be ſo valuable, or rather unvaluable a Jewel, that the wiſe Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth us <hi>to buy it</hi> at any rate,
<note place="margin">Prov. 23.23.</note> but to <hi>ſell</hi> it at no rate; then certainly Error which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, muſt needs be as evil and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41777:12"/>perverting of the firſt and leading Faculty of the Soul, and a drawing it beſide the Truth, which it was made on purpoſe to contemplate, but alſo in that it produceth ſo many pernicious conſequents in the world. When God confounded the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That they were ſcattered abroad upon the face of the Earth,
<note place="margin">Gen, 11.3.</note> and left off to build the City.</hi> And that confuſion of Mind and Language which hath befallen us as the juſt deſert and proper fruit of our fins, hath hindred the <hi>building</hi> up of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of mens ſouls, to Eternal Life: And hath ſcattered and ſevered men one from another in their Affections and Aſſociations.

<note place="margin">Amos 3.9.</note> Can two walk together ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be agreed?</hi> Yea, it hath occaſioned many to become indifferent, &amp; others Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in matters of Religion: And all theſe things have conſpired to produce another effect of dangerous conſequence, even the putting of a ſtumbling block in the way, to

                     <p>The beſt and moſt proper <hi>Expedient</hi> to help us againſt theſe <hi>growing miſchiefs,</hi> is to get our ſouls well ballaſted with ſubſtantial Knowledge of the Fundamentals of our Faith, that an over-large <hi>ſail of Affections,</hi> may not betray us to thoſe prejudices that are prepared againſt us, by the various <hi>Winds of ſtrange Doctrine</hi> that are abroad.

In this Allegation, they do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrong the Word of God in attempting to detract from its Authority, but alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their own cauſe, by giving us juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuſpect either the <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne</hi> of thoſe that would impoſe upon us by ſuch a Non-concluding Argument.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41777:13"/>yet they would make it ſeem, as near as they can, to be agreeable to it. And it hence appears that they account an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from the Scriptures to be very firm and powerful, ſeeing they take ſuch pains to wreſt the Scriptures to make them ſpeak that which they never intended, on their ſide.</p>
                     <p>It is then very evident (and may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the honour of this <hi>ſure word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie</hi>) that men of all Profeſſions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> do appeal to it as <hi>the laſt Judge</hi> in all Controverſies appertaining to our Chriſtian Faith. But the great thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, is, What is the beſt way for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Scriptures?</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts, if either <hi>Self-intereſt,</hi> or the juſt <hi>Judgment of God</hi> upon them, did not quite put out their eyes, could not poſſibly give up themſelves to going round in theſe mills which grind for their advantage. In treating of the Authority of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> they firſt will have the Scriptures to obtain Authority from the Teſtimony of the <hi>Church,</hi> and then the Authority of the Church ſhall be eſtabliſhed from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Scriptures. So that the Church, before its Authority be proved, muſt give Authority to the Scriptures, and then the Scriptures which they ſuppoſe to have received their Authority from the Church, muſt give Authority to the Church. And in like manner they deal about the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41777:14"/>
                        <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the Scriptures. For if we ask, Who muſt have Authority ſo to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Scriptures, that we muſt reſt in that Interpretation? They will tell you, <hi>The Church.</hi> And who is that Church? but he whom they ſuppoſe the Head of the Church, <hi>The Pope.</hi> So that, firſt that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which the <hi>Pope</hi> gives of the Scriptures, muſt eſtabliſh his Authority to interpret them; and then by vertue of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with which he conceives himſelf to be inveſted by the Scriptures, he takes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But we may well reckon it a conſiderable part of our happineſs in matters of our Faith, that as we do, upon good grounds, believe the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Scriptures, to be ſuch as needs not to be <hi>ſupported</hi> by the <hi>Pope;</hi> but to which indeed he ought to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> himſelf, and by which he muſt be <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> So we believe, upon ſufficient grounds, that for the Interpretation of Scripture in matters neceſſary to our ſalvation, we need not ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> to be informed. We ſhould eſteem it an unpardonable injury, both to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of our Heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> if we ſhould ſuppoſe that he had left his <hi>Will</hi> in order to our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, involved in ſuch intricacies, as ſhould not be obvious to be apprehended by thoſe that with an <hi>honeſt heart,</hi> ſet themſelves to <hi>ſearch</hi> the Scriptures. And whereas in matters of leſs moment, there are ſome
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41777:14"/>dark places of Scripture, which the Lord hath thought meet to leave for the exerciſe of our <hi>Industry,</hi> and trial of our <hi>Humility;</hi> As to theſe we ſay, that as a man may be <hi>ſaved</hi> without a diſtinct underſtanding them, ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> not onely may erre, but <hi>hath</hi> fouly erred in attempting the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of them. And I may reaſonably add before I leave this, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in pleading for a neceſſity of <hi>appealing</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> as the <hi>laſt Judge</hi> of the Interpretation of Scripture, do quite ſhake the foundation of his power by overloading it with a too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high ſtructure. For if we muſt needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our ſelves to be at a loſs as to the meaning of the Scriptures, unleſs we have the <hi>gracious Nod</hi> of his <hi>pretended Holineſs</hi> to confirm it, then why may we not as well ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our ſelves not rightly to underſtand thoſe Scriptures that are alleadged for the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority to interpret Scripture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Authority do confirm us in this meaning of them? And if ſo, then the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority to interpret the Scriptures is wholly founded (as I intimated before) upon his own <hi>Magiſterial deciding</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scriptures. And if even our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf,
<note place="margin">John 5.31.</note> my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not true;</hi> then why may we not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority, which is wholly built upon <hi>his own Teſtimony?</hi> And if the <hi>Popes</hi> authority in this caſe be not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confirmed, then are we as far to ſeek for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41777:15"/>the meaning of the Scriptures, as before he delivered his judgment. And conſequently the appealing to him in this matter, is ſo far from <hi>putting an end to all ſtrife,</hi> that it is the way to <hi>continue an endleſs ſtrife,</hi> till he hath better Aſſerted his own authority, then ever yet he hath done. And therefore we may very reaſonably <hi>invert</hi> this Argument, and ſay, that if the appealing to the <hi>Pope,</hi> be not the way to ſatisfie our ſaith, but rather to make it <hi>giddy</hi> by <hi>running round</hi> in theſe <hi>mazes;</hi> therefore it is not the beſt way to refer our ſelves to him as an <hi>Arbitrator,</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire</hi> in thoſe differences that are amongſt us, about the <hi>meaning</hi> of ſome Texts of <hi>Scriptures.</hi> If yet they perſiſt in pleading <hi>neceſſity</hi> to draw us to this inconvenience, and that without putting it to this refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſuit will never be at an end. We anſwer, That as the caſe is very ſad in our Church, in regard of theſe <hi>diviſions of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben;</hi> ſo we may well ſuppoſe that the <hi>evil eye</hi> with which they look upon us, repreſents it as much <hi>worſe</hi> then it is, when they would draw us to lean upon a <hi>broken Reed</hi> for fear of falling, to reſt upon that for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of our Faith, which is not able to <hi>uphold it ſelf</hi> (I mean the <hi>Pope's authority</hi>) and therefore will afford but a ſorry ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to us. Beſides, when we find that in the <hi>Apoſtles times,</hi> there was great cauſe to complain of Multitudes of falſe Teachers, which then were riſen up in the Church
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41777:15"/>(all which, no doubt, did pretend to the <hi>Patronage</hi> of the Scriptures, as our Modern <hi>Opiniators</hi> now do) and yet we never hear St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who complains ſo much of them, to appeal to St. <hi>Peter</hi> (who was then alive, and able to give a better conſtruction of the Scriptures than thoſe that call themſelves his <hi>Succeſſors</hi>) for deciding thoſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and pronouncing who was in the right; But he proceeds to cut his way by the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,

                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41777:16"/>And though for the preſent it afford us no ſmall trouble in the Church, that men of <hi>perverſe mindes</hi> will not ſee the plain and true meaning of ſome Scriptures, becauſe they are blinded with <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceit:</hi> yet do we not think that the onely expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to remedy this, is <hi>to turn Papiſts,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Pope hath nothing to ſhew as a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> for his <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage,</hi> and therefore we ſhould be never the better for appealing to him: and alſo becauſe we doubt not but the Lord who is pleaſed to permit theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours for the trial and exerciſe of our Faith, when we have ſuffered under them as much as he thinks meet for us, will (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out applying our ſelves to this indirect courſe) <hi>ſtabliſh,

                     </p>
                     <p>I might add, to make this up weight, the contrary judgements of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popes,</hi> which have for ſome time made a great ſtir in the Church, and muſt needs be a great diſtraction to the mindes of them that were bound by their Religion to reſt upon the judgement of an <hi>infallible</hi> perſon, when it was ſo hard to determine which of the <hi>two contraries</hi> was <hi>truly infallible.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that in the ſucceſſions in that See, there have been divers that have <hi>contradicted</hi> the judgement of their <hi>Predeceſſors;</hi> yea, we are not certain, but that the ſame Pope may the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41777:16"/>next year eſteem himſelf infallible in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is quite <hi>contrary,</hi> to what he now doth <hi>infallibly determine:</hi> and theſe caſes muſt needs <hi>puzzle</hi> the Faith of thoſe that apply themſelves to ſuch a judge as may be ſubject to ſuch <hi>alterations</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety. But theſe things have been ſo fully and excellently managed by far abler hands, that I ſhall content my ſelf with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a brief hint of them. And this I think is ſufficient to convince any perſon of an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed minde,</hi> That there is neither <hi>neceſſity</hi> nor <hi>convenience</hi> to invite us to refer our ſelves to the Pope for deciding of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, about the interpretation of difficult Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed: As there are many places of Scripture, which are not eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; ſo it behooves us, both to be <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious</hi> in uſing the means which God affords us for attaining the knowledge of them; and withal, to be very <hi>modeſt</hi> in paſſing our judgements concerning the meaning of them. And indeed it is moſtly to be <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> that, they are moſt <hi>confident</hi> of their underſtanding the darkeſt places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that have very little to <hi>ſupport</hi> this confidence, but onely that good <hi>Opinion</hi> they have thought meet to entertain of their own <hi>abilities.</hi> And as the Moraliſt ſaith of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and natural knowledge,
<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                        <hi>Multi ad ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam perveniſſent, niſi putâſſent ſe jam perve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſe:</hi> Mens confidence that they are in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41777:17"/>right, hinders them from finding out their errour, and ſeeking after the truth: So we may ſay of ſpiritual Knowledge, that one great thing which keeps many from the knowledge and belief of the truth, and locks them up faſt in the <hi>fetters</hi> of errours, is that preſumption they have taken up, that they are in the <hi>right,</hi> and that it is not <hi>poſſible</hi> they ſhould be <hi>deceived;</hi> and therefore <hi>Though you bray them in a morter, yet will not this wiſdom depart from them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the interpreting of Scripture it hath alwaies been obſerved, as a general Rule, that <hi>That interpretation which is nearest to the letter, is the ſafeſt and moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine;</hi> and that <hi>The further men go from the letter, the more hazzardous path they tread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed, if the litteral meaning do either contradict our <hi>Senſes</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary to any other more <hi>plain Text,</hi> or to the <hi>analogy of Faith;</hi> then we muſt leave the letter, and look for another meaning, that will not run us upon ſuch <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</hi> So when the Prophet ſpeaks of <hi>the calves of our lips,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.3.</note> we muſt needs qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie it, by rendring it the Sacrifice of <hi>Praiſe</hi> and Thankſgiving, which proceeding from thankful lips and hearts, is more acceptable to God, then the offering of Calves or Lambs was under the old Law. So when the Scripture applies to God, <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> and <hi>mouth,</hi> and <hi>eyes,</hi> &amp;c. we muſt not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41777:17"/>with the <hi>Anthropomorphitae</hi> entertain ſuch groſs and abſurd conceits of God, as to think him to be a <hi>body,</hi> and endued with ſuch parts of a body as be in us: but we muſt underſtand thoſe expreſſions to ſet forth unto us, ſuch works of God in the World, as ſome-what reſemble theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ours, in which we uſe thoſe <hi>members</hi> of our bodies as <hi>Inſtruments?</hi> So when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſent him not to baptize,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17.</note> but to preach the Goſpel;</hi> for as much as in the former verſes, the Apoſtle expreſly tells us, that he had <hi>Baptiſed</hi> ſome, which he could not have done without a commiſſion; we muſt therefore underſtand it, that Chriſt ſent him not <hi>ſo much</hi> to Baptize as to Preach; even as the ſame negative particle in other places,
<note place="margin">Mat. 9.13.</note> doth not deny <hi>abſolutely</hi> but <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively:</hi> as in that Text, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi> So when the Papiſts pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly urge the letter of thoſe words,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.16.</note> 
                        <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> to prove the Body of Chriſt to be preſent, in <hi>their ſenſe,</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> we ſay, That foraſmuch as this is both contrary to what our <hi>ſenſes</hi> witneſs, and is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to <hi>reaſon,</hi> and alſo deſtroys the very <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of a Sacrament; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a great injury to the Text, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here ſo pertinaciouſly to the <hi>letter</hi> of it, and not to qualifie it with a milder and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible <hi>conſtruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This then is one extream in which many run on to the <hi>wronging</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41777:18"/>of their own <hi>judgements,</hi> when they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in adhering to the <hi>letter.</hi> And indeed ſuch a pertinaciouſneſs, as it ſometimes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues men to be guilty of a fond <hi>ignorance,</hi> ſo for the moſt part it ſmells of a <hi>deſign:</hi> for I have ſtill obſerved, that they who would be over-ſtrict in ſticking to the letter of a Text, when they have conceived it meet to ſerve their own <hi>turn,</hi> would be forward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to run off from the letter, when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation would ſuit better with their <hi>purpoſe:</hi> And therefore it argues that they are not onely <hi>deceived</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but have a deſign to <hi>deceive</hi> others alſo.</p>
                     <p>But there are others, who run in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extream,</hi> which is equally dangerous, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that, without neceſſity do, fly to a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>myſtical</hi> ſenſe, ſo as quite to reject the <hi>literal:</hi> and this, as it doth commonly proceed from <hi>affectation,</hi> and a deſire to ſeem to take notice of ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>thing more than vulgar eyes are aware of; ſo it is, for the moſt part, uſed to ſerve a <hi>deſign,</hi> to evade the force of ſome plain &amp; convincing Scripture, by <hi>mudding the water</hi> that ſo themſelves and their tenets may eſcape <hi>unſeen.</hi> Did it not ſmell of a <hi>deſign</hi> in thoſe <hi>female teachers,</hi> who when that Text was alledged againſt their uſurping of this office,

                        <hi>I ſuffer not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to teach;</hi> would ſeek to evade it by giving a myſtical interpretation thereof, as if by <hi>woman</hi> ſhould be underſtood <hi>the fleſh,</hi> by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41777:18"/>which the Apoſtle will not have us to be taught. But ſo it is, that too many do not ſearch the Scriptures, to the end that they may <hi>conform</hi> their own <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> to this <hi>Rule,</hi> but that they may <hi>warp</hi> the Rule as far as poſſible, to a compliance with the irregularity of their own <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed, it hath always been the practice of the godly Divines and Fathers of the Church, to endeavour to raiſe up their own and their Readers <hi>Meditations</hi> to high and ſpiritual things, upon occaſion of ſome hiſtorical paſſage in the Scriptures: and there is no doubt but we may very <hi>profitably</hi> tread the ſame ſteps: but yet we had need to take heed that we be not tempted to follow theſe Meditations or <hi>divine Fancies,</hi> ſo far that they draw us to an utter leaving and forgetting of the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of a Text.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> As in vitious Courſes, ſo alſo in erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Opinions men go from bad to worſe. The experience of our age hath ſadly confirmed this. The ſad paſs that many are come to at this day, in matters of Religion.</head>
                     <p>THe ways of Truth and Virtue are to our corrupt nature like the <hi>ſteep aſcent</hi> of an high Hill, which we do not recover without much <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>difficulty:</hi> But the wayes of vice and errour are like the <hi>deſcent,</hi> which is not onely eaſie but <hi>precipitant.</hi> If a man begin to run down a ſteep Hill, he cannot ſtop when he will, but may much endanger himſelf before he can recover the command of his own motion: Even ſo men that with great heat of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided zeal have ſet themſelves to run down this <hi>precipice</hi> of errours, cannot ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bounds; but are very apt to outrun thoſe limits which they propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at their firſt ſetting out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs be ſuppoſed to run in a very dangerous courſe. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of ſtrife,
<note place="margin">Prov. 17.14.</note> 
                        <hi>The beginning of ſtrife is as when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41777:21"/>one letteth out water; therefore leave off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, before it be medled with,</hi> may very fitly be applyed to <hi>errour.</hi> Its beginnings are commonly ſmall and <hi>modeſt,</hi> but when we have given a little way to it, it will enlarge its paſſage even beyond the <hi>expectation</hi> of him that began it: which ſhould therefore make every man afraid to medle with that, which himſelf ſhall not be able to command in a while.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Waters</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> were at firſt ſo ſhallow,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.4, 5.</note> as to be but up to the <hi>ankles,</hi> then they roſe up to the <hi>knees,</hi> afterwards to the <hi>loyns,</hi> and at laſt became <hi>a River that a man could not paſs through.</hi> The <hi>Cloud</hi> which the Prophets ſervant ſaw, was at firſt in bigneſs but like <hi>a mans hand;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Kin. 18.47, 44.</note> but in a while it overſpread the <hi>whole Heaven,</hi> and poured forth abundance of <hi>Rain</hi> upon the Earth: even ſo thoſe Notions and <hi>novel Opinions,</hi> which in their beginning have ſeemed ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, as not to deſerve any great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, have proceeded by degrees to overſpread the Firmament, and to darken the Sun of the Goſpel: thoſe waters which at firſt ſeemed ſo ſhallow, that a Childe might play in them without danger, have by degrees ſwelled like <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſo as to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow</hi> all their Banks, and to threaten a <hi>deluge</hi> to the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>As in vicious practices it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <hi>Nemo repente fuit turpiſſimus.</hi> Men firſt hearken <hi>to the counſel of the ungodly,</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41777:21"/>and then proceed to <hi>walk in the way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1.</note> till at laſt they come <hi>to ſit down in the ſeat of ſcorners</hi> at God and goodneſs. Yea ſo inſenſibly do men ſlide into this gulph of ſin, that they do not foreſee the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe they are venturing upon; but by giving way to vice, do become by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſo bad, as they could not once have imagined it poſſible for them to be. When the Prophet foretold <hi>Hazael,</hi> what a bloody man he would be, when he ſhould come to the Kingdom of <hi>Syria;</hi> he replyes,
<note place="margin">2 King. 8.13.</note> 
                        <hi>Is thy ſervant a dog, that I ſhould do ſuch things?</hi> and it is very likely that he did not imagine while he was a private perſon, that he could have ſo much wickedneſs in him, as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he did manifeſt when he came to have power in his hands.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame we may ſay of errours in judgement, that men have not onely <hi>taken their degrees</hi> in them from bad to worſe, and ſo as to outſtrip in the ſucceeding year, the errours which they held the year before, but even to <hi>outſtrip their own thoughts,</hi> and to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go thoſe bounds and limits that they had ſet to themſelves, in their firſt entring upon theſe dangerous courſes.</p>
                     <p>I believe that if any man had been ſo much a Prophet, as for twenty or thirty years ago, to have foretold to many perſons of our age, what they would have come to by this time, they would have replyed as <hi>Hazael</hi> did to <hi>Eliſha:</hi> yea, if they had but ſeen the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41777:22"/>picture of ſuch a <hi>Monſter</hi> repreſented unto them as now themſelves are, they would have been the firſt to have caſt <hi>ſtones</hi> at it. Thoſe that begun firſt to ſcruple at the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> part of the worſhip of our Church, did little expect to have grown to that paſs as to diſown that Church in which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were born and baptized, as <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> Thoſe that were ſo zealous for the purity of Gods Ordinances, and for the powerful and frequent <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word, as to forſake their own Pariſhes and go many miles to hear a <hi>Sermon,</hi> did little think that they ſhould have lived to ſee themſelves become <hi>deſpiſers,</hi> and <hi>diſowners</hi> of thoſe Ordinances which they then did ſo highly value, and ſcorners of that <hi>preaching</hi> which then they followed with ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and pains-taking. Thoſe that began from a ſenſe of the benefit and neceſſity of that great Chriſtian Duty of <hi>counſelling</hi> and <hi>ſtirring up</hi> one another to that which is good, to proceed to appoint ſome <hi>ſet-times</hi> for private meetings for ſuch purpoſes, did little think to have improved themſelves ſo far in ſpritual pride and ſelf-conceit, as to venture with <hi>

<note place="margin">2 Chro. 26.17, 18</note> Much leſs that they ſhould have gone ſo far in <hi>the way of Corah</hi> and his company, as to tell the Prieſts of the

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10.14, 17.</note>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> and that which God is wont to make uſe of for this end): yea, to eſteem the <hi>prayers</hi> of our Church, as no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Popiſh <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> (which were compoſed by them that laid down their <hi>lives</hi> for the witneſs of the Truth againſt <hi>Popiſh idolatry</hi> and <hi>errour</hi>). And in a word, (according to their own <hi>prophane</hi> expreſſion) to eſteem themſelves <hi>above</hi> thoſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which are infinitely above the beſt of men. Thoſe that firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to raiſe <hi>doubts</hi> concerning ſome points of our <hi>Faith,</hi> were ſo ſhort-fighted as not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41777:23"/>to ſee the pernicious conſequents of <hi>diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances</hi> and <hi>unſettlement</hi> in the Church, and did little think to ſee raked out of the grave moſt of the <hi>old errours,</hi> which had for ſo long time lain buried in forgetfulneſs, that ſo many of the notions of the old <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> of the <hi>Arians, Macedonians, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, Socinians, Antitrinitarians, Antiſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts,</hi> ſhould have been revived under the notion of <hi>new lights;</hi> while in the mean time, the good <hi>old Orthodox Faith</hi> is ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized, as <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> But ſuch is the deceitfulneſs of mans heart, and ſuch the ſubtlety and unwearied induſtry of that enemy of the Church, that it is an hard matter for men to ſet bounds to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when once they have tranſgreſſed bounds.</p>
                     <p>To have foretold theſe things in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our Civil and Eccleſiaſtical <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions,</hi> would have ſeemed to many <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning,</hi> but <hi>injudicious</hi> people, not onely to have foretold <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>unlikely</hi> matters, but alſo to have <hi>propheſied evil and not good,</hi> meerly out of <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt thoſe ſpecious <hi>pretences.</hi> But as the Maxims of <hi>Policy</hi> do ſhew, and the ſad <hi>experience</hi> of our Age doth confirm, that in the Civil State, it is far eaſier to <hi>find</hi> faults in a Government, then to <hi>exchange</hi> it for a better, and that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> muſt needs reſolve it ſelf into <hi>Anarchy</hi> at laſt. So in <hi>Church matters,</hi> it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been obſerved to be a dangerous
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41777:23"/>courſe to remove a ſtone out of the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of our Faith, though with never ſo fair pretences of better <hi>poliſhing</hi> it, and proteſtations of <hi>placing</hi> it there again. A man of clear Reaſon and unbyaſſed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might partly have foreſeen the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of theſe things, in the beginning: And I hope all ſucceeding Ages will learn this, from the calamities which we have felt, that it is better for every Chriſtian to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his <hi>Patience</hi> in bearing with, and his <hi>Devotion</hi> in praying for, the Reformation of ſome miſtakes and <hi>comings-ſhort</hi> in Church-Government, then to pull down the whole Edifice, under pretence of a <hi>through-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> leſt the <hi>Remedy</hi> prove far more dangerous than the <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How ſad a paſs are we come to in matters of <hi>Faith!</hi> when ſome talk ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of a <hi>Light within,</hi> that ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to lead a man to Heaven, if he walk anſwerably to it; which muſt either be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> or <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> denying any ſuch depravation of our Natures, as doth diſable us from doing that which is good by our own ſtrength; or that there is any ſuch diſtance between God and man, as ſhould make us ſtand in need of a <hi>Mediator</hi> to work out a <hi>Reconciliation:</hi> Or elſe we muſt take it to be a meer <hi>Meteor,</hi> exhaled by the heat of a <hi>miſguided Zeal,</hi> from the <hi>Dunghil</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and elevated unto the middle Region of their <hi>Brain,</hi> the ſeat of <hi>Fancy;</hi> a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour

And as every Workman is more noble then his Work, ſo he that made all Things, muſt be a more <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Excellent Being,</hi> then any or all of thoſe Creatures: And this was ſufficient to convince them that there is a <hi>Being</hi> Infinite in all Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Perfections, in Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who had a Being before any of the Creatures, even from all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and gave beginning and being to all things beſide Himſelf; and this is that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being</hi> and <hi>first Cauſe</hi> which we call, <hi>GOD.</hi>

                        <hi>contrary;</hi> ſo whoſoever doth deſire to pleaſe his Maker, muſt endeavour to be <hi>like</hi> him in his <hi>Imitable Attributes,</hi> of Holineſs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Goodneſs, and Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that whoſoever doth not endeavour to frame his Heart and Life to a <hi>conformity</hi> to the Nature and Will of God, cannot <hi>pleaſe</hi> him, nor be ſaid to anſwer the ends of his Creation: Nor yet can reaſonably expect to <hi>partake</hi> of thoſe rewards which Nature prompts us to hope for from the goodneſs of God in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, nor to be <hi>free</hi> from thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Nature tells us we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſuffer from the Juſtice of God, in diſpleaſing and provoking him.</p>
                     <p>Thus far, I ſay, the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> will eaſily carry any man who doth not violently diſturb it in its proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And from hence the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Ro 1.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> in the forecited place, doth conclude, that even the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though they had not enjoyed the written Law of God, <hi>yet would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe before Gods Tribunal;</hi> for that they had not <hi>walked up</hi> to theſe Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but had entertained <hi>diſhonourable</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions concerning him whom Reaſon did prompt them to believe to be their Maker: Some of them denying the being of God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by <hi>multiplying</hi> it, confounding their own conceptions touching a <hi>firſt cauſe:</hi> Moſt of them, by the impious <hi>practices</hi> which they imputed to their gods, diſhonouring that <hi>God</hi> in whoſe Throne they ſet theſe <hi>Idols:</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41777:27"/>And all of them, by their own impious and wicked <hi>lives,</hi> coming ſhort of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the Law of Nature did oblige them to pay to him that made them.</p>
                     <p>As to this light that ſhines unto us from the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and all the hoſt thereof, the <hi>earth</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> and all that therein is, the Pſalmiſt tells us,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 19.3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>That it is gone forth into the ends of the world, and that there is no Speech nor Language where the voice of it is not heard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that this is not <hi>ſufficient</hi> to lead a man to heaven without a further guide, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both in that the Lord hath thought meet to ſet up a <hi>clearer Light,</hi> before his own people in all ages, the light of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the light of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to us <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> which though they differ in the way of <hi>adminiſtration;</hi> the ſervices of the Law pointing them to <hi>Christ</hi> that was <hi>to come,</hi> the ſervices of the Goſpel pointing us to <hi>Christ as already come;</hi> and alſo in the <hi>clearneſs</hi> of them, the <hi>Law</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Chriſt in <hi>Types</hi> and ſhadows, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> taking off the <hi>vail</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> face, and letting us <hi>with open face,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> as in a glaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of the Lord:</hi> Yet I ſay, That as the light of the Goſpel is ſufficient to us Chriſtians, ſo was the light of the Law and Prophets <hi>ſufficient</hi> to the Jews to point them to Chriſt, who was repreſented in all their typical <hi>oblations</hi> and <hi>expiations,</hi> and who is the onely way to eternal Righteouſneſs and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41777:27"/>Salvation. Now foraſmuch as the great God of heaven and earth, who maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>in vain,</hi> hath given theſe further Lights to his people, which would have been <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> if the former had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients we may hence conclude, that he did not eſteem the Light of Nature <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to guide us in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Beſide, This that might be <hi>known</hi> of God by the <hi>creatures,</hi> though it might indeed <hi>ſhew</hi> us what ſervice and obedience it was reaſonable for us to perform unto God, yet could it not <hi>enable</hi> us to perform it aright. Some of the Philoſophers have obſerved ſo much of a <hi>depravation</hi> in mans <hi>nature,</hi> as hath made them break forth into <hi>direful</hi> and tragical <hi>exclamations,</hi> concerning the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate of man. But the <hi>light of Nature</hi> could never ſhew them, without the light of the <hi>Word</hi> of God, the <hi>original</hi> of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation, the creation of the <hi>Protoplaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God made with him, both in behalf of himſelf and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; the <hi>fall</hi> of our firſt <hi>Parents</hi> and of us all in them, from our original Rectitude and Holineſs of Nature; nor the way and <hi>means</hi> how to have our Nature <hi>reformed,</hi> and our Perſons <hi>reconciled</hi> unto God, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our obedience <hi>ſupplyed. Fleſh and blood hath never revealed,</hi> nor is it in its power to reveal this unto us, but the holy Ghoſt that dictated the Goſpel, is that alone
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41777:28"/>which reveals unto us <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Merits,</hi> as our onely <hi>propitiation</hi> and way to <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 4.12.</note> That <hi>there is not Salvation in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither is there any other name under Heaven given amongst men, whereby we may be ſaved, but onely this name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This one word, <hi>Chriſt-crucified,</hi> is the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Goſpel, and the end and <hi>deſign</hi> of the Law and the Prophets alſo: the ſubſtance of all that we ought to <hi>preach,</hi> and the Object both of your and our <hi>Faith.</hi> And that we may the better underſtand this <hi>Foundation</hi> of our Belief, concerning Jeſus Chriſt as our Mediator; I ſhall begin this diſcourſe with opening theſe two terms, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mediator:</hi> which I am therfore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to do, becauſe theſe terms are uſed in <hi>different</hi> ſignifications in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, from whence men of <hi>corrupt</hi> mindes, and who have endeavoured to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt others, have taken occaſion to deduce many <hi>Paradoxes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I preſume is ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the moſt that are Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion, that it would be needleſs to ſpend time in the opening of it. In the Old Teſtament he is called <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who in the New Teſtament is called <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This name <hi>Meſſiah</hi> we meet with in ſeveral places of the Old Teſtament, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. and 84.9. and 89.51. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.13. The name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41777:28"/>frequent in the New Teſtament, that I ſhall not ſtand to inſtance in particular places.</p>
                     <p>Now this name is ſometimes uſed (and that moſt properly) to denote the <hi>Word made fleſh,</hi> or <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jo. 1.14. 1 Tim. 3.16. Mat. 1.16.</note> his name is rendred <hi>Jeſus, who is called Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>he that denyeth Jeſus to be Chriſt, is ſaid to be a lyar and an Antichriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes this word <hi>Christ,</hi> is uſed by a Metonyny, to ſignifie the Church of Chriſt, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. and according to ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Is enim eſt Chriſti in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam amor,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Beza</hi> upon the place: <hi>Such is the love of Chriſt unto his Church, that though he filleth all in all, yet is he pleaſed to eſteem himſelf, as it were, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without his Body the Church:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church is called, <hi>The fulneſs of him who filleth all in all,</hi> Eph. 1.23. To which purpoſe we may refer theſe Texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40, 45. together with <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is put for the <hi>Church,</hi> which is his <hi>myſtical Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, that we be not deceived about this Word, we muſt take notice of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the New Teſtament, which have reference to Chriſt. As firſt, <hi>To be Chriſt's,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>to be a Chriſtian, Mark</hi> 9.41. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. To <hi>be ſubject to Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. and chap. 3.23. To <hi>be truely regenerate, Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. and chap. 5.24.</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41777:29"/>
                     <p>Secondly, To <hi>be with Chriſt,</hi> ſignifies to <hi>enjoy bleſſedneſs</hi> with him, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. comp. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. comp. <hi>John</hi> 17.24. So, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>To be in Chriſt,</hi> ſignifies to be <hi>converted to the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5, 7, 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. Sometime indeed it is taken for an <hi>outward cleaving to Christ,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 15.2. But more uſually it is put for a <hi>real conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the heart unto Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5. and chap. 5.20. So to be <hi>found in Chriſt,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>in the Faith of Christ, Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To be <hi>By Chriſt,</hi> ſignifieth to be <hi>redeemed by Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>in them,</hi> whom he hath <hi>ſanctified</hi> by his holy Spirit, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to himſelf as Members of his myſtical Body, <hi>John</hi> 17.23, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. And Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>with them,</hi> whom, though moſt unworthy, he hath not yet <hi>wholly divorced</hi> from himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.19. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9.41. Or elſe with thoſe, whom he doth moſt <hi>dearly love,</hi> and for this cauſe, aſſiſt and defend, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, To be <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> is to be <hi>without the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which had not had the Goſpel preached unto them, are ſaid to be without Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Sometimes alſo to be <hi>without
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41777:29"/>Chriſt,</hi> ſignifieth to be <hi>without dependance upon Chriſt and aſſiſtance from him,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5.</p>
                     <p>To this we may add, that to be <hi>weak in Chriſt,</hi> ſometimes ſignifieth to be <hi>conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe infirmities, that were in the humane Nature of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. To be <hi>dead in Chriſt,</hi> ſignifieth to be <hi>dead in the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14, 16. To <hi>ſpeak the truth in Chriſt,</hi> is to ſpeak it <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ambition,</hi> and meerly <hi>for the glory of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 19.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things I thought neceſſary to point you unto, becauſe many have been apt to wreſt theſe places of Scripture beſide the true meaning of them, both to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of themſelves, by inducing a belief of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and to the <hi>diſhonour</hi> of Chriſt, by entertaining diſhonourable conceits of him, through miſunderſtanding the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                     <p>For the word <hi>Mediatour,</hi> it ſignifieth in general one that <hi>interpoſeth</hi> between two or more perſons: for, <hi>a Mediator is not of one, Gal.</hi> 3.20.</p>
                     <p>Now in Scripture we ſometime read of a <hi>Mediator to carry meſſages</hi> between two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So <hi>Moſes</hi> is called a <hi>Mediator,</hi> becauſe he delivered the Commands of God to the people, and the anſwer of the people unto God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. comp. <hi>Exo.</hi> 19.3. &amp;c. and chap. 20.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.5.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Divines ſpeak of a <hi>Conſervatory
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41777:30"/>Mediation,</hi> which tends to perſerve unity and friendſhip between friends: In this ſenſe ſome do believe Chriſt to be a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Elect Angels,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>confirmation</hi> of them in their eſtate of holineſs and happineſs. But in this I <hi>determine</hi> nothing, becauſe the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are ſo ſparing in ſpeaking of it</p>
                     <p>The uſual acception of this word <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> is to ſignifie him that <hi>reconciles</hi> parties that be at difference: and in this ſenſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the <hi>word made fleſh,</hi> is truely and properly called a <hi>Mediator to reconcile God and man,</hi> becauſe he interpoſeth himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, in this <hi>difference</hi> that ſin hath made; to <hi>reconcile</hi> Gods <hi>juſtice</hi> to us, by making <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for our ſin; and to <hi>reconcile</hi> us to God by <hi>ſanctifying</hi> our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and making us conformable to his will; in this life <hi>inchoatly,</hi> and at death per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The holy Scriptures being owned (at leaſt in outward profeſſion) by men of all profeſſions that lay claim to the common name of Chriſtianity; we may therefore take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Arguments drawn from them, ſhould put an end to all ſtrife amongſt us. The deſign and method of the four following Chapters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</head>
                     <p>THe Reverence we owe to the authority of the holy Scriptures, doth oblige e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Chriſtian, not onely to account it a neceſſary piece of <hi>humility</hi> to ſubſcribe to the doctrine thereof, as the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him that made us, and to whom we owe all obedience: but alſo to eſteem it the <hi>ſafeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>prudential</hi> courſe, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and embrace the truths thereof, as the Word of him who is <hi>Wiſdom</hi> it ſelf, and therefore cannot err or be deceived, and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> it ſelf, and therefore we may be ſure he will not endeavour to ſeduce or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude us. So that though there be divers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41777:31"/>things contained in this Sacred Volume, which our ſhallow capacities cannot reach to comprehend, yet we finde reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to impute it to the <hi>defects</hi> of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not to any <hi>over-ſight</hi> in thoſe Sacred Writings, that we cannot always ſee a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of every thing therein delivered. And the Soveraign Authority, and infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of him that inſpired thoſe holy men that wrote theſe Books, is a ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to move us, to a reverent ſubmiſſion to thoſe matters of Faith which ſurpaſs the reach of our reaſon: and therefore as every ſober Profeſſor of Chriſtianity makes the Word of God the <hi>foundation</hi> of his Faith; ſo the beſt Arguments that can be produced for the <hi>confirming</hi> of our Belief in that Faith, which hath been delivered unto us, will be ſuch as are fetched from this Sacred Prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuary of holy Writ.</p>
                     <p>And as I was mentioning it before,
<note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> for the honour of the Word of God, that men of <hi>all Sects</hi> and perſwaſions, who center in the common Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, do (at leaſt) pretend great <hi>reverence</hi> to theſe Writings, and (whether in good earneſt, or in <hi>deſign,</hi> to put off their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the more plauſibly in the world) do endeavour to repreſent even their moſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox and incredible Notions, as the Doctrine of the Spirit of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: we may therefore very reaſonably expect that Arguments drawn from the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41777:31"/>
                        <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſhould be <hi>convineing</hi> to them, and an <hi>end of all ſtrife.</hi> And further, that the fair and plain <hi>meaning</hi> of the words of Scripture, which is moſt <hi>obvious</hi> to every man of underſtanding, and which hath been received by the Church of God in all <hi>ages</hi> ſhould be embraced by them as well as by us, as the ground upon which all Arguments are to be built: It being as abſurd in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> for one or a few men to expect that his or their ſingle <hi>Vote,</hi> for ſome ſingular meaning of a plain Text of Scripture, ſhould be heard in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>judgement</hi> of the Church of God in all ages; as in matters of <hi>ſenſe</hi> it would be for one man confidently and contentiouſly to pronounce that colour to be <hi>white</hi> or <hi>red,</hi> which all his Neighbours, and people of all Ages before him, have received under the notion of <hi>black.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may therefore take it for granted, that Arguments drawn from the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious ſenſe</hi> of the Scripture, ſuch as hath been received by the Church in all Ages, ſhould be accounted ſufficient, both to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> the faith of thoſe that are ſerious in Chriſtianity, and alſo to <hi>convince</hi> (or at leaſt put to <hi>ſilence</hi>) thoſe that are diſſenting from us.</p>
                     <p>In order therefore to the confirming of us in the belief of this Truth, which is the ſubſtance of the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, that, <hi>The Word made fleſh,</hi> or, <hi>God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41777:32"/>the Son manifeſt in the fleſh, hath truely and really undertaken and performed the Office of a Mediator, to reconcile God and man;</hi> I ſhall propound theſe <hi>four</hi> general Heads to be conſidered and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the Lord did <hi>promiſe</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, and to all the Fathers and Prophets of the Old Teſtament, <hi>his own Son to become man,</hi> and in the Union of theſe two Natures, to perform all thoſe Offices which were neceſſary in order to our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Time</hi> which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the accompliſhing of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Propheſies, and for the ſending of the Son of God into the World, is long ſince <hi>expired;</hi> and conſequently that we ought ſtedfaſtly to believe that our Saviour is <hi>already</hi> come in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That we have full and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grounds to believe, that the ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom the New Teſtament holds forth unto us, and in whom we and all the Churches of God in all Ages have <hi>believed,</hi> is that very Perſon who was promiſed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to come as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts in the New Teſtament, do <hi>hold forth</hi> unto us ſuch a Chriſt, as was really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> Hypoſtatically united in one <hi>Perſon;</hi> and who did in a real and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe <hi>ſatisfie</hi> Gods Juſtice for our ſins,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41777:32"/>and <hi>purchaſe</hi> eternal Salvation for us by his <hi>Merits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On this <hi>Rock</hi> is the Church of God built:
<note place="margin">Matt. 16.18.</note> On this, have every one of us built our particular Faith, and in this we had need to be fully and perſectly <hi>ſetled.</hi> And he that is confirmed in the truth of theſe four Poſitions, is confirmed in the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel.

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The firſt Propoſition confirmed in its two Branches, <hi>viz. Firſt,</hi> That God did promiſe to the Fathers of the Old Teſtament, to ſend his Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, to take our Nature upon him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of theſe two Natures, he ſhould perform all thoſe Offices which were neceſſary in order to our Redemption and Salvation.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ALL the Promiſes of God are Yea,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> Faithfulneſs and Truth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Words of the <hi>God of Truth,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.2.</note> who
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41777:33"/>cannot lye. Hath he ſpoken it, and ſhall it not ſtand? Hath he promiſed, and ſhall he not make it good?
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.18.</note> Behold Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away ſooner, then one iota or tittle of his Word fail till all be fulfilled.</hi> And therefore if we make it appear that ſuch a thing was <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> by God to the Fathers, that the Son of God ſhould be Incarnate, to the end that he might be a Mediator between God and man, and the Authour of Eternal Salvation to us; I ſuppoſe, no man that reads this, will doubt but that in the fulneſs of Time, theſe promises would take effect.</p>
                     <p>Now that God did all along to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Old Teſtament, make ſuch a promiſe, will be evident by conſidering: Firſt, The <hi>Names and Titles</hi> that are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him that was promiſed to come as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which will ſhew that he was foretold to be ſuch an one as ſhould be truly God, and truly Man. Secondly, The <hi>Offices</hi> that are applyed to him, which will ſhew that he was foretold to come as the Saviour of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> which up and down the Old Teſtament, are given to the Meſſiah that was promiſed; do ſhew that, for his Perſon, he ſhould be God and Man; and ſome of them alſo do point at his Office.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> We find him ſtiled, <hi>The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſhould break the Serpents head:</hi> His Humanity is denoted in his being the Seed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41777:33"/>of the Woman; his Divinity in that Office that is aſcribed to him, To break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, which may very fitly be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>He was manifeſt to deſtroy the works of the Devil:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note> Now no perſon can enter into the ſtrong mans houſe, except he be ſtronger then he. To the ſame purpoſe is that other expreſſion, where he is called,
<note place="margin">Gen. 22.18.</note> 
                        <hi>The Seed of Abraham, in whom all the families of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed;</hi> which as it foretels his humane Nature which ſhould be born of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo it ſhews that he was to come as a general good to the world, not onely to be <hi>the glory of his people Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lu. 2.31.</note> but alſo <hi>to be a Light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> might, through him, be delivered from that curſe which they were liable unto through Sin, and might be partakers of the bleſſedneſs that he hath purchaſed, by his Sufferings and Obedience. And this likewiſe foreſhews that he ſhould be the Son of God, in that his ſufferings and obedience, are repreſented of ſuch infinit value, as to purchaſe ſo great and general benefits to Mankind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is ſometimes called by the name of <hi>Shiloh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> by which word is underſtood the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as is evident by the <hi>Caldee</hi>-Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, and moſt of the Ancient Rabbies, who in this place for <hi>Shiloh,</hi> do read <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> As to the ſignification of this word, ſome derive it from <gap reason="foreign">

Others derive it from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to <hi>ſend,</hi> and ſo it may denote his Office, that he ſhould be ſent by God the Father into the world, for the <hi>Salvation</hi> thereof. Others derive it from <gap reason="foreign">

                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.14.</note> However we interpret this word, yet ſtill it ſpeaks the Meſſiah to be ſuch a Perſon, and deſigned to ſuch an Office, as I ſaid before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is elſewhere ſtiled, <hi>A Prophet whom the Lord ſhould raiſe up to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>like unto</hi> Moſes;
<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall raiſe up unto thee a Prophet:</hi> this both ſhews that he ſhould be a real and not a fantaſtical Perſon, and it ſets before us one of thoſe Offices which he ſhould undertake in order to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: He ſhall be raiſed up <hi>in the midſt of thee, of thy brethren:</hi> and this ſhews that he was to be the Son of Man. That this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie belongs to Chriſt, is evident from <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. and Chap. 7.37.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <note place="margin">Pſal. 80.15.</note> 
                        <hi>David</hi> calls him, <hi>The Man of Gods right hand; and the Son of man, whom he had made ſtrong for himſelf.</hi> And this ſhews both
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41777:34"/>the truth of his Divine Nature, where in he was <hi>the man of Gods right hand,</hi> the Son of God,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.</note> equal to the Father in Power and Glory, in Bleſſedneſs and Eternity; and alſo it foretels that God the Father ſhould <hi>prepare him a body</hi> in which he might ſuffer for our ſins, and which by the Hypoſtatical union with the Divine Nature, was <hi>made ſtrong</hi> to undergo that wrath of God, and to break through the bonds of Death, which no meer man would have been able to do; &amp; likewiſe by the Union of the Divinity with the Humanity of Chriſt, his ſuffering ſhould become of infinit value, and,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> 
                        <hi>This blood of Chriſt being offered up by the Eternal Spirit, ſhould be able to purge our conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi> Further, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> calls him <hi>his Lord,</hi> who was foretold to be <hi>his Son</hi> after the fleſh;
<note place="margin">Pſ. 110.1.</note>

                     <p n="5">5. He is called <hi>Immanuel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 7.14.</note> which ſhews the admirable and unconceivable Union of the Divine Perſon of the Word: with that fleſh that he took upon him, God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>to dwel with men on earth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 8.12.</note> and <hi>to pitch his Tabernacle amongſt us,</hi> in a more near and eſpecial manner, when the Word was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be made fleſh.
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.14.</note> And this ſtupendious Tranſaction was not for nothing, but for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41777:35"/>this end that being a middle Perſon between God and us, <hi>Medium participationis,</hi> one that did partake of <hi>both Natures;</hi> he might fitly ſtand as <hi>a middle Perſon,
<note place="margin">Job. 9.33.</note> and lay his hand upon us both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. We have other Titles given to him in that eminent Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7, which ſerve to denote both his Natures and Offices. <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given:</hi> This ſhews the humane Nature of Chriſt which ſhould be taken into that near Union with the Perſon of the Son of God. <hi>And the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders;</hi> This denotes that Kingly Office which Chriſt as our Mediator, did undertake: <hi>And his Name ſhall be called Wonderful,</hi> in regard of the Ineffable Union of the two Natures in the Perſon of one Mediator; to which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the fleſh.</hi> Further he is called, <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,</hi> not onely in reſpect of his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note> which is called <hi>The Wiſdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but chiefly in reſpect of his Office in the Church as our Mediator: he is our Prophet, who is ſent to reveal unto us the Will of God and the way to Heaven. He is called, <hi>The mighty God,</hi> which denotes him that was before ſaid to be born of a Woman, to be alſo God equal with the Father: <hi>The everlaſting Father,</hi> or Father of Eternity; not as if the firſt Perſon in the Trinity had taken our Nature, or ſuffered to ſatisfie his own
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41777:35"/>Juſtice; but onely to denote the <hi>Eternity</hi> of his Divine Nature, who was our Mediator: Though as man he was conceived <hi>in time</hi> in the Womb of the Bleſſed Virgin, yet as God he was begotten of his Father <hi>before all Words,</hi> even from everlaſting. Further,
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.14.</note> he is called <hi>The Prince of Peace,</hi> to note the end of his coming, to make Peace between God and us. And finally it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.20</note> that <hi>of the encreaſe of his government there ſhall be no end,</hi> &amp;c. to note both the great encreaſe of his Kingdom,
<note place="margin">Dan. 2.35.</note> 
                        <hi>that Stone cut out of the Mountains without hands, ſhall fill the earth.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that his Kingdom ſhall not be ſubject to thoſe viciſſitudes and decayes, to which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms are ſubject.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.25.</note> 
                        <hi>He ſhall reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Further, that evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 42.1. calls him <hi>Gods ſervant whom he did uphold, his Elect in whom his ſoul delighted.</hi> As to his Divine Nature, he was God <hi>equal with the Father:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.</note> but in reſpect of this Office of Mediator, as he was <hi>Gods Elect,</hi> whom the Father did chooſe to appoint and accept as our ſurety and a propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſice in our behalf, ſo he was in ſome reſpect <hi>the ſervant of the Father,</hi> and tells us that he came into the world <hi>to do the Will of his Father.</hi> Nor may we therefore,
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.34.</note> with the <hi>Arians,</hi> think that Chriſt's being ſent by the Father, and being called his Servant, doth argue any <hi>inequality</hi> between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son; nor yet, with the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41777:36"/>that the holy Ghoſt being <hi>ſent from the Father and the Son,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jo. 15.26.</note> this doth argue him to be <hi>unequal</hi> or inferiour to them both. For that Rule in divinity is very rational as well as Orthodox, that <hi>Miſſio &amp; Obedientia non tollunt aequalitatem Perſonarum in Sacrâ Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:</hi> The Fathers ſending the Son, and the Father and Son ſending the holy Ghoſt, doth not argue the Father to be above the Son, nor them both to be above the holy Ghoſt; but onely denotes that <hi>order</hi> in which each <hi>perſon</hi> in the Sacred Trinity is pleaſed to tranſact its ſeveral <hi>operations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <note place="margin">Jer. 23.6.</note> He is termed by <hi>Jeremiah, The Lord our Righteouſneſs:</hi> the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is no where in Scripture applied to any Creature, doth argue him to be truely God; and the other word ſhews the end of his coming into the World, even <hi>to make recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for iniquity,
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is frequently ſtiled by the name of <hi>David, Jerem.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23, 24. and chap. 37.24, 25. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3.5.

Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he is called by this Name, may be either 1.

And in the New Teſtament, he is ſaid to be

Or elſe he may be called <hi>David,</hi> becauſe the promiſe was <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in a ſpecial and ſolemn manner to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that of his ſeed ſhould come the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.

And theſe Propheſies do betoken both the <hi>humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, who ſhould come of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and his <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, in that he was to be King of the Church which is called <hi>The Iſrael of God.</hi>

And though Chriſt did not in his life-time, take upon him the <hi>temporal</hi> juriſdiction over <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but tells his Diſciples they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in looking for this; and tells <hi>Pilate</hi> that <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world;</hi> that is,

                     <p n="11">11. In <hi>Malachi</hi> the laſt of the Prophets, he is called, <hi>the Lord whom they ſought after,</hi> and <hi>the Angel,</hi>

<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31.</note>

                     <p>To theſe I might add divers other names that are given to the Meſſiah in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but theſe are ſufficient: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the very name <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as it ſpeaks him to be anoynted of God to that threefold Office of <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> to which Offices men uſed to be ſet a-part by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> ſo they ſuppoſe him to be ſuch a perſon as ſhould be qualified and made meet for theſe Offices, and to this end it was neceſſary that he ſhould be God and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41777:38"/>Man, that he might be a middle perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both.</p>
                     <p>Having conſidered his Names &amp; Titles, let us proceed, in the ſecond place, to take a view of what the Old Teſtament ſpeaks of the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> to which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was deſigned by God the Father. And there will be the leſs need to dwell long upon this, becauſe I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſomething of it upon the former Head. We commonly believe, that Jeſus Chriſt, in order to the accompliſhing of this great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of our Salvation, As he was pleaſed to ſtoop ſo low as to take our Nature into that neer Union with his Divine Perſon, ſo that he was both truly God of the ſubſtance of his Father, and truely Man conſiſting of a reaſonable ſoul and humane fleſh; So in the hypoſtatical Union of theſe two Natures, he did perform the office of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and of a <hi>King</hi> to his Church. And that we may ſee that we neither wrong Chriſt in imputing that to him, which may either be diſhonourable or diſagreeing to him; nor yet our ſelves or others in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining fond and groundleſs conceits as Articles of our Religion; I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew you that Chriſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Fathers of the Old Teſtament, as one that ſhould undertake, and go through with each of theſe Offices.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it was foretold that he ſhould be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> one that ſhould both by his own preaching and the preaching of his Apoſtles,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41777:38"/>while he was upon the earth, and after his Aſcenſion by giving the holy Ghoſt to his Miniſters, ſhew unto us the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all things that ſhould be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us, to know, believe, and do in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our pleaſing God in this world, and everlaſting enjoying of him in the world to come. This is evident from that promiſe which God made by <hi>Moſes,
<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15.</note> The Lord thy God ſhall raiſe up unto thee a Prophet, from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, and him ſhall ye hear in all things:</hi> to which agrees that voice which came from Heaven,
<note place="margin">Mat. 17.5.</note> in our Saviour's Transfiguration. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</hi> Again, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of Chriſt, ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                        <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek: he hath ſent me to bind up the broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord:</hi> And this our Saviour, when he was upon earth, applyed to himſelf, and told the people that they had then ſeen <hi>that Scripture fulfilled before their eyes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 4.18.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that he ſhould be our <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt,</hi> one that ſhould do that in reality and ſubſtance, which was done onely typically by all the Oblations enjoyned in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, that he ſhould offer up an <hi>expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> and <hi>propitiatory</hi> ſacrifice to Gods juſtice, even his own body, and thereby make an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41777:39"/>Atonement for us. <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith that Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prophet) <hi>he hath born our griefs,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.4, 5, 6.</note> and carried our ſorrows. He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities, the chastiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray: we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</hi> And again, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many;
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</note> for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi> And further,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.</note> 
                        <hi>He was numbred with the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and he bare the ſins of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſours.</hi> Of whom the Prophet ſpeaks all this, you may hear from St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s expoſition of this place to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 8.34, 35. 1 Pet. 2.22.</note> and from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to our Saviour: Therefore he is called <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23.6. and he is ſaid to <hi>ſwallow up death in victory, Iſa.</hi> 25.8. and his people are called <hi>The ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed of the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 35.10.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It was foretold that he ſhould be a <hi>King:</hi> not that <hi>his Kingdom ſhould be of this World,</hi> that is, after the manner of worldly Kingdoms,
<note place="margin">Joh. 18.36.</note> as the carnal Jews did conceit, of which errour himſelf doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them. But that he ſhould have ſuch a Kingdom, wherein he ſhould Rule his own people as a Shepherd doth his Sheep, and his enemies with a rod of Iron, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their fury againſt his people, to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their devices, and to daſh in pieces
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41777:39"/>at laſt thoſe that are his implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.10, 11.</note> Behold the Lord ſhall come with a ſtrong hand, and his arm ſhall rule for him: he ſhall feed his Flock like a Shepherd: he ſhall gather the lambs in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> And by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Ask of me, and I will give thee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thine inheritance,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 2.8, 9.</note> and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion. Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of Iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel.</hi> So again the Prophet <hi>Jerem.
<note place="margin">Jer. 23.5.</note> Behold a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute judgement and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs!</hi> And who is this? but he whom he calls in the next verſe, <hi>The Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> To this end he is ſo often called <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.24, 25.</note> and ſaid to <hi>ſit upon the throne of his father David.</hi> Not in a literal ſenſe, as ſome conceit, as if he ſhould come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Reign upon earth, and ſet up his Throne in the ſame place where <hi>David</hi> Reigned, but that he ſhould exerciſe a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual juriſdiction over <hi>The Iſrael of God,</hi> as I have ſpoken before. To this purpoſe alſo is that which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>The God of heavens ſetting up a Kingdom that ſhould never be deſtroyed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 2.44.</note> which is ſpoken of the Kingdom of Chriſt: And that <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaks of thus, <hi>Behold thy King cometh unto thee, Zechar.</hi> 9.9. which is applyed to our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.7.</p>
                     <p>By all this it is ſufficiently evident, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſober and impartial eye, that the Lord
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41777:40"/>did promiſe to the Fathers of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>his own Son to become man, and to be a Mediator between God and man:</hi> and that accordingly the Spirit of God in the Law and the Prophets, hath attributed to the Meſſiah, who was promiſed, ſuch <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> as ſpeak him to be ſuch a Perſon: and withal, that they foretel him to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Father, to ſuch <hi>Offices</hi> as were neceſſary to be performed in order to our Redemption and Salvation.</p>

                     <p>THat God the Father was pleaſed in his wonderful goodneſs and tenderneſs toward Mankind, to make very gracious promiſes concerning the ſending of his own
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41777:40"/>Son into the World to be our Redeemer and Saviour, I think hath been made ſo evident, that he who would go about to cavil at it, muſt either bid open defiance to the belief of the Law and the Prophets, or if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with his mouth that he believeth them, yet he will ſhew indeed by his wreſting of them, that he bears very little reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them. Now, as we have ſeen how the ineſtimable <hi>love</hi> of God was manifeſt, in that man had no ſooner fallen from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Creatour, and given him occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pronounce that ſentence of the Law, which his Juſtice did ſhew to be the due deſert of ſin; but he did preſently, even in the midſt of judgement remember mercy, and promiſed unto man a Saviour, that ſhould deliver him from that curſe of the Law which was but now denounced: So now let us ſee the admirable <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> of God, who hath fulfilled with his hand what he promiſed with his mouth, and, <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> did ſend forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle tells us that the Doctrine which they preached of Chriſt, being then already come and crucified for our ſins, was <hi>to the Jews a ſtumbling-block,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23, 44.</note> and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs:</hi> and we may add, that <hi>what he told us before, we have ſtill reaſon to tell you weeping,</hi>

To obviate therefore the growing vanity of thoſe that are ſo looſe in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and to help to eſtabliſh us all in the belief of that Faith, into which we have been Baptized; I ſhall endeavour by ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to confirm this Truth, that we are verily to believe the time to be come, and long ſince paſt, when the Son of God was to come in the fleſh, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an offering to Divine Juſtice for our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,
<note n="1" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I argue from the <hi>calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> to the Knowledge and Service of the true God. When God was pleaſed to make choice of <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity for his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, he gave them ſeveral Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41777:41"/>and Rites,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.14.</note> which the Apoſtle calls <hi>a middle-wall of partition</hi> between them and the Gentiles: God having appointed the obſervation of theſe to be the cognizance of his own people: ſo that the Gentiles not obſerving theſe, this made, as it were, a partition-wall to ſeparate the Jews from the Gentiles. And if we look into all the Writings of the Prophets, whenſoever we finde any thing ſpoken of the Converſion of the Gentiles, we finde it tyed to the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the fleſh. So when the Prophet ſpeaks of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.6.</note> and the <hi>forming of him from the womb,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the tribes of Judah: I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 60.3.</note> that thou mayst be my Salvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſpeaking of the coming of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall ariſe upon the earth: and the Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and the King to the brightneſs of thy riſing.</hi> I might inſtance in many other Propheſies, concerning the Converſion of the Gentiles, all which do foretel its coming to paſs about the time of the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the fleſh:
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.14, 15.</note> who was to <hi>break down the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall of partition that was between us, and ſo of twain to make one people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that the Gentiles have been many of them long ſince turned to the knowledge and obedience of the true God, is evident:
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> Chriſt himſelf preached the Goſpel to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41777:42"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and afterward to the whole City, and many of them believed in him: And afterwards we finde that divers of the Apoſtles went and preached the Goſpel to the Gentiles: yea, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is expreſly ſtiled <hi>The Apostle of the Gentiles:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 3.2, 3.</note> And he ſaith, <hi>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not of the Gentiles alſo?
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.29, 30.</note> Yes, of the Gentiles alſo: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is one God that will juſtifie the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by Faith, and the uncircumciſion through Faith.</hi> We read in the New Teſtament, of the Churches of God, at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Corinth, at Galatia,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and many other places, which before were Heatheniſh places. Yea, to go no further then this our Iſland, which was ſometime of the number of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Nations; yea, of the remote parts of the Gentiles: and yet, as we know that at preſent we do worſhip the true God; ſo the Hiſtories of our Nation do report that we have been turned from Idols near 1600 years ago, which argues the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be long ſince come.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<note n="2" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> we argue from the <hi>deſtruction of the ſecond Temple</hi> built at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was promiſed to come into that Temple, and therefore that Temple being long ſince deſtroyed, it argues him to be long ſince come. We read, that when the Foundation of this later houſe was laid, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ancient men,
<note place="margin">Ezr. 3.12.</note> who had ſeen the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer houſe, went to ſee how far this came ſhort of the firſt;</hi> and this did diſcourage the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41777:42"/>people from going on with the Work. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, God ſends the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> to encourage them to go on, and he ſpeaks thus:
<note place="margin">Hag. 2.3.</note> 
                        <hi>Who is left among you that ſaw this houſe in its firſt glory? Is it not in your eyes in compariſon of it as nothing? Yet now be ſtrong, O Zerubbabel,</hi> &amp;c. And how doth he incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them? <hi>I will ſhake all Nations,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.</note> and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with Glory, ſaith the Lord of Hosts: And the glory of the latter houſe ſhall be greater then the former.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</note> You ſee then that the latter Temple was promiſed to excel the former: And how ſhould that be? Not for famous ſtructure, for as to this it came ſo far ſhort of it, that it ſeemed in their eyes in compariſon of it as nothing: nor was it ſo glorious as to the Veſſels of the Temple, for there were <hi>five</hi> things wanting in this latter Temple, which were in the former: The <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>Mercy-ſeat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Tables of Stone,</hi> wherein God with his own hand wrote the Ten Commandments, the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim,</hi> and <hi>the holy anointing Oyl:</hi> Now ſure it muſt be ſome great thing that could make up all theſe wants, and render the Glory of the latter Temple, greater than that of the former. Now as to this, the Prophet tells us, that <hi>the deſire of all Nations,</hi> that is, Chriſt who was deſirable to all Nations, as he in whom all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, He ſhould <hi>come into this Temple</hi> to teach and work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41777:43"/>there, and this ſhould make it more glorious. The former Temple had <hi>Solomon</hi> to pray and offer Sacrifice in it, but a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Solomon</hi> was in this latter Temple. So alſo <hi>Malachi</hi> tells them,
<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare my way before me: and the Lord whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into his Temple: even the meſſenger of the Covenant in whom ye delight.</hi> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Meſſenger of the Covenant is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and he is promiſed to come into this Temple; and therefore we muſt conclude, that his coming muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the utter deſtruction of this Temple. Now it is ſufficiently evident, that this Temple together with the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> hath been utterly deſtroyed near 1600 years ago:
<note place="margin">Buchol. <hi>Chronol.</hi>
                        </note> for it was in the 71 year of Chriſt that <hi>Titus</hi> took the City, and ſet fire upon the Temple, and ever ſince it hath lain deſolate; yea, when <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, in deſpight to the Chriſtian Religion, gave the Jews liberty and encouragement to rebuild the Temple; there was an earthquake which ſo ſhook the foundation that they had laid, that it left not one ſtone upon another:
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> and when for all this they obſtinately perſiſted in attempting to build the Temple, God ſent a fire from Heaven which conſumed divers of the Builders. And therefore ſeeing that Temple is long ſince deſtroyed, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is undoubtedly long ſince come.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I argue from the <hi>Scepter's being
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41777:43"/>departed from Judah;</hi> the government,
<note n="3" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> even all face of a government being departed from that Nation. <hi>Jacob</hi> in bleſſing his Sons,
<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> tells <hi>Judah</hi> that <hi>The Scepter ſhould not depart from him, nor the law giver from between his feet, till Shiloh ſhould come.</hi> This place is frequently urged for the conviction of the preſent Jews, and to which indeed they can oppoſe nothing, but a reſolute and ſtiff-necked obſtinacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That by <hi>Shiloh</hi> is underſtood the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> I have ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and the Jews themſelves confeſs it. And for the preciſe time when the Scepter departed, we need not to be very nice in enquiring. <hi>Judah</hi> was governed by <hi>Kings,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joſeph. Antig.</note> by the ſpace of 514 years in all. At the end whereof they were carried away <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> into <hi>Babylon</hi> by the ſpace of 70 years. After this they had <hi>Governours</hi> for divers years: then the <hi>Maccabees</hi> held both the Government and High-Prieſt-hood for four ſucceſſions. Then <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> the firſt made himſelf <hi>King,</hi> and ſo the Poſterity of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> held both the Kingdom and Prieſt-hood, till the days of <hi>Herod</hi> the Son of <hi>Antipater:</hi> He ſlew <hi>Hircanus</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtobulus,</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Aſmonean</hi> Family, and alſo many of the Jewiſh <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the ſole Government and Kingdom of <hi>Judea.</hi> And now many thought that the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah:</hi> for <hi>Herod</hi> was a ſtranger born, who had the Government, and therefore many did now
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41777:44"/>begin to look for the Meſſiah. Some were ſuch flatterers of <hi>Herod</hi> that they perſwaded him that he was the Meſſiah, and thence (ſay ſome) came that Sect of <hi>Herodians</hi> mentioned in the Evangeliſts. There was alſo one <hi>Theudas,</hi> not long before Chriſt, who boaſted himſelf to be the Meſſiah, and <hi>drew a company of people after him,
<note place="margin">Acts 5.36.</note> but was deſtroyed with thoſe that followed him.</hi> And after him <hi>aroſe Judas of Galilee in the days of taxing;
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>verſ.</hi> 37.</note> Joſephus</hi> ſaith, this man aroſe in the time of the gathering of that Tax, which was levyed by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> when Chriſt was born, and ſome conceive thoſe <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
<note place="margin">Luke 13.2, 3.</note> to have been followers of him. And divers others have ariſen ſince, who have boaſted themſelves to be the Meſſiah. So that though the generality of the Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chriſt, yet many of them did follow falſe chriſts;
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.43.</note> as himſelf told them, <hi>I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if another man come in his own name, him ye will receive.</hi> Thus you ſee how many of the <hi>worſe</hi> ſort of the Jews, believing the Scepter to be already departed, did follow falſe chriſts: but if we look further, we ſhall find that many of the <hi>devout</hi> ſort amongſt them did begin now to expect the coming of the Meſſiah:

                     <p>Others ſay that there was ſome kinde of government (though much ſhattered and broken) till the time when the City was <hi>deſtroyed:</hi> but, granting this, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as I ſhewed before, that the City was utterly deſtroyed, and the people reduced into a Roman Colony, and the very face of a Common-wealth utterly aboliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them well nigh 1600 years ago: And therefore we may firmly conclude, that the Meſſiah is long ſince come.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,
<note n="4" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I argue from the <hi>breaking and decay of the fourth Monarchy</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his dream ſaw an <hi>Image,</hi> whoſe <hi>Head was of gold, the breast and arms of ſilver,
<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> the belly and thighs of braſs, the legs of iron, the feet part of iron, and part of clay.</hi> In this Image were repreſented to the King the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſhould be in the World. The <hi>Head of gold</hi> did ſignifie the <hi>Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>verſ.</hi> 38.</note> which was a very glorious Kingdom; after which ſucceeded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſians,</hi> when <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> overcame and ſlew <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kings: this was alſo a great Kingdom, but came as far ſhort of the glory of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kingdom, as ſilver comes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41777:45"/>ſhort of the worth of Gold; and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>two Arms,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 39.</note> becauſe there were two Nations joyned, the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> After this aroſe a third Monarchy, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Darius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 39.</note> the laſt King of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> this was the thigh of Braſs. After this it is ſaid, that a <hi>fourth</hi> Kingdom ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
<note place="margin">Ver. 40.</note> which ſhould be a very ſtrong King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and therefore is compared to <hi>legs of Iron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now whereas the King ſaw that <hi>a Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands,
<note place="margin">Ver. 44.</note> ſhould break to pieces all this Image, and afterward grow to a great Mountain,</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>in the dayes of theſe Kings,</hi> that is, the Kings which ſhould be of the fourth Monarchy, <hi>The God of Heaven ſhall ſet up a Kingdom which never ſhall be deſtroyed, and it ſhall break in pieces all thoſe Kingdoms, and conſume them, and it ſelf ſhall ſtand up for ever.</hi> This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who is compared to a Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.16.</note> Chriſt is called by the Prophet, <hi>a Stone,</hi> and he is ſaid to be <hi>cut out without hands;</hi> that is, ſay ſome, he was conceived in the womb of the bleſſed Virgin, without the help of a man: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (and perhaps more probably) think this to belong to the Kingdom of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, which ſhould be ſet up or propagated, not by the power and policy of man, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms were, but by the Almighty power of God alone.</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41777:45"/>
                     <p>This Kingdom of <hi>the Stone,</hi> we ſee, was to begin in the time of the <hi>fourth Monarchy;</hi> Now what this fourth Monarchy was, is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly interpreted: but which interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever we imbrace, this Argument will be ſufficiently cogent.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was dead,
<note place="margin">Joſephus Antiq. Sir Walt. Rawley.</note> his Dominions and Kingdoms, fell into divers mens hands: <hi>Antigonus</hi> was Lord of <hi>Aſia, Seleucus</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the bordering Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> had <hi>Helleſpont: Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Macedon;</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Lagus,</hi> held <hi>Egypt.</hi> After a while, theſe five King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were reduced into two, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Kingdom, which was called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Seleucidae;</hi> and the <hi>Fgyptian</hi> Kingdom, called the Kingdom of the <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> and theſe ſome take to be the legs of Iron, and the feet, part of Iron, part of Clay. But according to this computation, the fourth Monarchy was gone ſomewhat before the birth of Chriſt; for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who was the laſt Queen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> divers years before Chriſt was born.</p>
                     <p>Others ſay, that this fourth Kingdom was the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, which had ten Toes, that is, ſo many Forms of Government. Now in the time of this Monarchy Chriſt was born, <hi>viz.</hi> in the days of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar:</hi> It is an Obſervation of a Learned man, that,
<note place="margin">M. Legh.</note> 
                        <hi>ver.</hi> 35. there is a two-fold Kingdom of the Meſſiah deſcribed; firſt, the Kingdom of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41777:46"/>
                        <hi>Stone,</hi> and then the Kingdom <hi>of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> The Stone ſhall firſt break in pieces the Gold, the Silver, the Braſs, the Iron and Clay; and then grow up into a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: That is, Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſhall come, ſhall break in pieces all thoſe 4 Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and afterward his Kingdom ſhall fill all the Earth. And ſo we know that while the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom ſtood in its ſtrength, the Kingdom of Chriſt was but ſmall, it was then the Kingdom <hi>of the Stone,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it became a <hi>Mountain;</hi> the Doctrine of the Goſpel then ſpread into all the world; while the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the moſt of them perſecuted the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, and endeavoured to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Promulgation of the Goſpel; but afterward when their power was cut ſhort, the Kingdom of Chriſt flouriſhed: The ſum of the Argument is this. There were <hi>four</hi> Monarchies to be erected by the God of Heaven in the world; In the dayes of the <hi>fourth</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be born, and his Kingdom ſet up. Now whether we take this fourth Monarchy for the <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, or for the <hi>Romans,</hi> both theſe are long ſince decayed: and therefore ſurely the Meſſiah is come in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly,
<note n="5" place="margin">Argu.</note> I argue from the <hi>exſpiring of the ſeventy weeks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 9.24. to the end.</note> ſpoken of, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. to the end of the Chapter: which you may read at your leaſure. It is generally agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this is a Prophecy concerning the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41777:46"/>time of the birth of the Meſſiah, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his death, and the end for which he was to die; and the Text ſpeaks plainly, that theſe weeks were determined, <hi>to finiſh tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of Sin, and to maze reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs;</hi> now this can be done by no other but by him that was the Saviour of the world: Yea, the name Meſſiah is twice mentioned, ſo that undoubtedly this is a Propheſie concerning the coming of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>Now as to what is meant by the <hi>Seventy weeks;</hi> it is thus agreed upon, that every day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>es for a year, ſo that ſeventy weeks are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eventy times ſeven years, that is, 400 and 90 years; and it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe ſeventy weeks, ſhould be from <hi>the going forth of the Commandment to reſtore and build Jeruſalem.</hi> Now here lyes the great difficulty when this time was, for the <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>four</hi> ſeveral times Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to build the City and the Temple:
<note place="margin">Ezra 1.1, 2.</note> The firſt was from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the firſt year of his reign: The ſecond from <hi>Darius,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hyſtaſpis</hi> after it had been ſome time hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by <hi>Cambyſes:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezra 6.</note> The third was given to <hi>Ezra,</hi> by <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezra 7.12. Neh. 2.</note> The fourth &amp; laſt was given to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who was But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the King. This commandment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out in the dayes of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> whether the ſame that gave the commandment to <hi>Ezra,</hi> or another of the ſame name, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find determined.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:41777:47"/>
                     <p>Now being it is not ſpecified in <hi>Daniel,</hi> from which of theſe times the ſeventy weeks ſhould begin, therefore there is ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence amongſt Interpreters, and Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, concerning it: Some make it to begin from that commandment given to <hi>Ezra</hi> from <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> after which the work went on without Lett, for we do not read that ever this Decree was revoked. And in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion this ſeems moſt probable:
<note place="margin">Chrono.</note> For both <hi>Bucholtzer,</hi> and whoſoever wrote the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology in the Margin of <hi>Joſephus Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> ſay, that from the time of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to <hi>Ezra,</hi> to the death of Chriſt are near about four hundred &amp; ninty years: And ſo this computation anſwers to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 9.25.</note> that, <hi>after ſeventy weeks the Meſſiah ſhould be cut off.</hi> Now, ſay we, Chriſt was born in the ſecond year of the ſixty ſixt week, and the thirty four year inchoat, which he lived upon Earth, make up juſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeventy weeks, and ſo the Propheſie was exactly fulfilled, beginning from the third commandment which was iſſued out for the building of the City.</p>
                     <p>Others there are that begin theſe weeks thirty ſeven years later, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> and ſo make them to end juſt at the time when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken and deſtroyed by <hi>Titus,</hi> led, I ſuppoſe, by theſe words;
<note place="margin">Ver. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>And the people of the Prince that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctuary, and the end thereof ſhall be with a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41777:47"/>flood, and to the end of the war deſolations are determined.</hi> But if we grant this, yet the ſeventy weeks are at an end many hundred of years ago, the City being deſtroyed (as I ſaid before) about the ſeventy one year of Chriſt. The ſum of the Argument is this: Theſe ſeventy weeks denote the number of 490 years, within which time the Meſſiah muſt be born and cut off: But theſe ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty weeks or 490 years, are ended many hundred of years ago: and therefore the Meſſiah is long ſince come.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly,
<note n="6" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I argue from the <hi>ceaſing of the Sacrifices,</hi> which were appointed by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, and extinguiſhing of that <hi>Prieſt-hood.</hi> That thoſe Sacrifices were to continue, and conſequently the Prieſt-hood that was to offer them, until the coming of the Meſſiah, and then to ceaſe, may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from that Text,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou did not deſire mine ear haſt thou boared: in burnt-offerings and ſin offerings thou haſt no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: Then ſaid I, Loe I come.</hi> When Chriſt ſhould come in the fleſh, then God declares that he would no more take delight in burnt-offerings and other oblations and expiations which were uſed under the Law. And that this Propheſie is to be applyed to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours coming in the fleſh, is evident, by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expoſition of it. <hi>Wherefore when he,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10.5, 6.</note> that is, Chriſt, <hi>cometh into the world, he ſaith, Sacrifice and offering, thou wouldeſt not,</hi> &amp;c. And a little further,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.</note> 
                        <hi>He take away the firſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41777:48"/>that he may establiſh the ſecond.</hi> Chriſt by the once Offering up of himſelf as an expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice for our ſins was to put an end to all thoſe legal oblations, which were Types of this great Oblation. Beſide, the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, that when the Meſſiah ſhould come,
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.27.</note> 
                        <hi>He ſhould cauſe the Sacrifice and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ceaſe.</hi> Indeed the very end and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of all thoſe Sacrifices did ſhew that they were to be aboliſhed at the coming of the Meſſiah, who was the true Sacrifice for ſin: God did not ſet them up that men might reſt in them, or expect pardon of ſin by them.
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1.</note> 
                        <hi>The Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with thoſe Sacrifices which they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red year by year, make the comers thereto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.</note> for then ſhould they not have ceaſed to be offered.</hi> And further, <hi>It was not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſin.</hi> All theſe Sacrifices did ſerve to ſhew them, that <hi>Without ſhedding of blood,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> of ſin; and did thereby teach them to look unto that <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1.29.</note> for juſtification and Salvation: and therefore, when Chriſt the true Sacrifice was offered, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, theſe Sacrifices were to ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>Now it is evident that theſe Sacrifices are long ſince quite ceaſed, the City of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> being long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: and this was the place where alone he had appointed them to offer Sacrifice:
<note place="margin">Deut. 12.5.</note>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41777:48"/>and therefore ſeeing he hath ſuffered this Place to be utterly deſtroyed, it argues, that it was his pleaſure, that theſe Sacrifices ſhould ceaſe to be offered:
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> 
                        <hi>For this man</hi> (that is, Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> The continual offering of Sacrifices under the Law did ſhew the imperfection of them, that they could not perfectly juſtifie thoſe for whom they were offered: Now what theſe Sacrifices, through their weakneſs were not able to do, God ſending forth his own Son, made under the Law, and made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, hath perfected. So that from the ceaſing of theſe Sacrifices which were appointed as Types of Chriſt, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Meſſiah the ſubſtance of all theſe ſhadows is already offered up for us.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly,
<note n="7" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I argue from the <hi>aboliſhing of the power of the Heathen Idols,</hi> and its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing of their <hi>Oracles.</hi> It was foretold that when the Meſſiah ſhould come, he ſhould deſtroy the Idols of the Gentiles which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been of ſo great power and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 2.18, 19.</note> 
                        <hi>The idols he ſhall utterly aboliſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) <hi>and they ſhall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth. In that day ſhall a man cast away his idols of ſilver and his idols of gold which they have made, to the Moles and to the Bats.</hi> And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41777:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> ſpeaking of the time of Chriſt's coming,
<note place="margin">Zech. 13.1, 2.</note> when the <hi>Fountain ſhould be ſet open for Judah and Jeruſalem to waſh in, for ſin &amp; for uncleanneſs:</hi> he adds, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they ſhall no more be remembred: And alſo I will cauſe the Prophets, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit to iſſue out of the land.</hi> You ſee then that it was propheſied, that at the time of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, the power of the idols ſhould decay, and the Oracles of the Heathen-gods be ſtruck dumb.</p>
                     <p>Now this is long ſince come to paſs: That which made the Idols of the Heathen to be in ſo much requeſt, was, that the Devil did many times enter into them, and ſpeak out of them, and ſhew ſtrange feats before them: But this power of the Devil was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way long ſince. The great Temple of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> and the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> that was ſo famous all over the world, is long ſince abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. It is related, that neer about the time when Chriſt was born, <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> ſent to enquire of the Oracle, and it told him that he could receive no Anſwer from him, for there was a <hi>Childe</hi> born in <hi>Judaea,</hi> who commanded him from thoſe ſhores: and this was the laſt voice that was heard from that Temple. And it is written by an Author of this Nation,
<note place="margin">S. Geo. Sands <hi>Travels.</hi>
                        </note> that a Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſailing neer thoſe coaſts, thoſe that were in it heard an hideous howling noiſe, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41777:49"/>one call to the Maſter of the Ship by name, and bid him tell, when he came to the ſhore, that the great god <hi>Pan</hi> was dead. Now the ſilencing of theſe Oracles doth ſhew the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be come.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, I argue that the Meſſiah is come,
<note n="8" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> becauſe the <hi>Genealogies of the Jews are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,</hi> that it is impoſſible to find out the Ancient Poſterity of <hi>David.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 11.1.</note> Chriſt we know was promiſed to come of <hi>the Seed of David,</hi> in divers places of the Prophets: And hence we may argue, That if God had ſo punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally foretold the Family of which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiah ſhould be born, then ſure he would take ſpecial care to keep the Pedegrees ſo orderly that it might be known of what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Chriſt's Mother was, that we might be the better confirmed in our Faith, that He which did come was the true Meſſiah. And it is evident that Gods providence did take great care to keep the Families diſtinct, that each man might know his own Pedegree: To this end he commanded,
<note place="margin">Num. 36.6, 7, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>That a man of one Tribe, ſhould not marry a wife of another Tribe, but that every man ſhould marry in his own Tribe.</hi> And to this purpoſe it is thought, that Commandment was given forth,
<note place="margin">Deut. 25.5. Joſephus Antiq.</note> that <hi>the younger Brother ſhould marry the Relict of his elder Brother, who died without iſſue.</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid to be ſo careful of this, that every family had its own Pedegree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record, which Records were kept in the Archives at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:41777:50"/>
                     <p>Now <hi>Herod</hi> the King ſeeing how much the <hi>Jews</hi> valued their deſcent from <hi>David,</hi> and other ſuch like Worthies; and knowing that himſelf was not a <hi>Jew,</hi> but a ſtranger born; cauſed all thoſe Books to be burned, in which the Pedegrees were recorded, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereby that the Families would be confounded, and his own baſe deſcent ſhould after ſome time be forgotten. Now ſince this time, theſe Records being loſt, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies are confounded; ſo that, though ſome few did know their Pedegrees for a while, yet now they are ſo forgotten, that no man can directly tell of what Family he is.</p>
                     <p>And therefore if God by his Providence did <hi>preſerve</hi> theſe Records ſo long, that it might be known that Chriſt came of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and did then ſuffer theſe Records to be utterly <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to be confounded; then may we from hence conclude, that the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is long ſince come in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,
<note n="9" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> There is another Argument urged by ſome, which though it be not of very great force to a Chriſtian, yet is it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſtop the mouth of a cavilling <hi>Jew,</hi> as being <hi>ad hominem,</hi> an Argument drawn from their own principles. The Argument is this: The <hi>Jews have a Tradition</hi> amongſt them, that as God made the world in ſix dayes, and then reſted the ſeventh; ſo the world ſhould ſtand ſix thouſand years, and then keep an everlaſting Sabbath. Now of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41777:50"/>theſe ſix thouſand years, they ſay, that two thouſand ſhould be before the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; two thouſand under the Law; and two thouſand under the Meſſiah. Now the four thouſandth year of the world is long ſince paſt. There are divers Opinions of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers</hi> concerning the preciſe time of Chriſts birth, which I ſhall not think need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be here ſet down: But according to the computation of moſt of them, the birth of Chriſt fell out not very far diſtant from the four thouſandth year of the world; and this might perhaps be one reaſon why ſo many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did about this time expect the coming of the Meſſiah, and followed divers falſe Chriſts, though they forſook the true One. But without doubt theſe four thouſand years are long ſince expired, and therefore according to their own Tradition, the Meſſiah is long ſince come in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen the point proved poſitively: Let us next conſider one of their chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the believing of the Meſſiah to be come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="object."/> They ſay that <hi>their ſins have hindred</hi> the Meſſiah from coming at the time which was appointed. The calling of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> the ceaſing of the Sacrifices, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſecond Temple, the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scepter, but eſpecially the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie concerning the Seventy weeks, do ſo urge them, that they can hardly deny, that the time fore-appointed is long ſince paſt:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41777:51"/>But they ſay, that the ſins of their Nation have hindred the accompliſhing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes at the appointed time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="anſwer."/> But this is a very weak refuge to flie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the ſins <hi>of their Fathers</hi> did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the making of theſe promiſes, and why ſhould they think that the ſins of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould hinder the fulfilling of them in due time? The beſtowing of Chriſt is the freeſt of all gifts: God doth not give him for the deſerts of any people. It was not for the merits of thoſe to whom he was promiſed, that God made theſe promiſes, and therefore the demerits of the Children could not hinder the accompliſhment of them.
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> The firſt time when God made this promiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> was, when there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in man to deſerve it; yea, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mans ſin which he had but newly committed, might have made God far from ſhewing any Mercy: So, when God renewed it by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iſraelites,
<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15.</note> it was at that time when they ſhewed themſelves a moſt unthankful &amp; rebellious people, who <hi>grieved the Lord forty years in the wilderneſs.</hi> And when the Prophets foretold the coming of the Meſſiah, it was in a time of great Wickedneſs among the people: That promiſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. was made in the days of <hi>Ahaz</hi> the worſt of all the Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. he tells them,
<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 5, 6.</note> that they had even <hi>wearied the Lord with their ſins.</hi> So, that other was made in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41777:51"/>the days of <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> when the land was ſo filled with wickedneſs, that the earth groaned under its inhabitants, till God eaſed it by ſending them into Captivity. Now if the abounding of ſin in the Fathers did not hinder the making of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; it is very unreaſonable to imagine that the ſins of the Children ſhould hinder the fulfilling of them at the time appointed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the promiſes concerning the Meſſiah were <hi>abſolutely expreſſed,</hi> without any reſpect to the worthineſs or unworthineſs of the people. <hi>Jacob</hi> doth not ſay,
<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> If the people be obedient, <hi>Shiloh</hi> ſhall come when the <hi>Scepter departs,</hi> but ſpeaks it abſolutely. The <hi>ſeventy weeks</hi> are ſaid to be determined;
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> not conditionally, if the people did pleaſe God, but abſolutely. And if the ſins of the people did not hinder the fulfilling of other Propheſies of this Nature, why ſhould they be thought to have hindred this? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, this is but a Cavil invented by the Jews of latter ages: for their fathers that lived about the time of Chriſts Birth, did look upon them as abſolute, and did expect the Meſſiah about that time, as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this cavil is only invented to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the obſtinacy of this Nation at this day. Nay, let us hear what a promiſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> mentioneth, <hi>If the children of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid do break my laws and keep not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 89.30, 31, 32.</note> &amp;c. <hi>then will I viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions with a rod, and their ſins with ſtripes;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41777:52"/>nevertheleſs my loving kindneſs will I not take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail: my Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gon out of my lips.</hi> And this muſt needs be underſtood of the Covenant concerning the ſending of the Meſſiah: ſo that their ſins could not hinder the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it in due time.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Meſſiah was promiſed to be a <hi>bleſſing to all Nations,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 21.16.</note> and therefore the ſins of one Nation could not hinder the ſending of him in due time. God promiſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that <hi>in his ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed:</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking from the Lord unto Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.6.</note> ſaith, <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the Tribes of Judah; I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my Salvation to the ends of the earth:</hi> The Gentiles were to receive benefit by his coming into the world, as well as the Jews, as I have before ſhewed: and therefore it would be unreaſonable to imagine that the ſins of that one Nation ſhould hinder the coming of Him, who was to be a bleſſing to all Nations.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.20.</note> God ſaith, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dye; the ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither ſhall the father bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the ſon: the righteouſneſs of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall be upon him, and the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him.</hi> Now if God will not puniſh the ſins of the father on the ſon, who is not acceſſary to his father's
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41777:52"/>faults; much leſs will he puniſh the ſins of the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon all the whole world, who were not acceſſary to their ſins.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> The Meſſiah was promiſed to come for this end, that he might <hi>take away ſin, to finiſh Tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſin, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.5.</note> and to be <hi>wounded for our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. as I have ſaid before: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould we think that the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin ſhould hinder his coming? Doth the ſickneſs of the Patient hinder the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi> from coming, whoſe office is to cure Diſeaſes, and there would be no need of him if men were not ſick? Yea ſome of the Learned do tell us, that the Jewiſh Rabbies that lived before Chriſt, did foretel that when the Meſſiah ſhould come, there would be a great abounding of Iniquity in the world; and therefore we may conclude this to be onely a Cavil of the later <hi>Jews,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their obſtinate ſlighting of the true Chriſt whom their Fathers crucified.</p>
                     <p>As for that fond conceit of ſome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſay that the Meſſiah is indeed come, but is hidden at the <hi>gates of Rome,</hi> and that it ſhall be ſome time before he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: This is ſo far lighter than vanity, that I ſhall take no further notice of it, then to put you in mind thereby of that heavy curſe of God that lies upon them; That though the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> for about two thouſand years ago, did tell them, that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41777:53"/>
                        <hi>the Lord ſhould ſuddenly come into his Temple,</hi> yet they will believe that he is ſtill to come. Yea, though they have felt the heavy wrath of God lying upon them to the utmoſt, for ſo many Ages; yea, though their condition be ſo ſad, that they have no Prophets to tell them how long it ſhall laſt, yet ſtill they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt in denying and oppoſing the true Chriſt. Let us pray for their Converſion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be ſetled our ſelves in this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Chriſtian Faith, that the Meſſiah who was promiſed to the Fathers, is long ſince come in the fleſh.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The third Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That we have full and ſufficient Grounds to believe, that the ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> which is held forth unto us in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in whom we and all the Churches of God in all Ages have believed, is that very Perſon who was promiſed to the Fathers to come as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or Saviour of the World; Confirmed by the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which he wrought to confirm this Truth, and by the fulfilling of all Propheſies in him.</head>
                     <p>THat a Saviour was promiſed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Old, and that theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are long ſince out of date, you have ſeen confirmed; ſo that conſequently we muſt look backward with the Eye of our Faith, to a Chriſt already exhibited, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to one yet to come. The next thing in which it will be neceſſary to have our Faith ſetled, is, that we are not deceived, as to that particular Perſon, upon whom we and all the Churches of God, for this ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41777:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>hundred years and upward, have pitched, as our Meſſiah or Saviour. And though the conſent of the Church in all Ages, be a very good Argument to ſatisfie us in this point, yet it may be neceſſary in theſe fickle times, to look for a firmer Ground to build our Faith upon, in this which is a matter of ſo great moment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> then,
<note n="1" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I argue from the many <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which Jeſus wrought,</hi> when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth; for the confirmation of this Truth, that he was indeed the Meſſiah that was promiſed. A <hi>Miracle,</hi> is a work that exceeds the power of any created cauſe, to produce by his own ſtrength, and therefore whoſoever can do miracles, is either God, or hath received power from God in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and ſupernatural manner. And as Gods giving power to any perſon to work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for the confirming of any point that he teacheth, is to be accounted as Gods ſetting his Seal to the truth thereof: So it would be unreaſonable, as well as impious, to imagin that the God of Truth ſhould ſet his Seal to a ly; and conſequently whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Doctrine hath been confirmed, by the the working of apparent and undeniable Miracles, we are to receive it as that which God himſelf hath commended to us as a Truth, and himſelf born witneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>Indeed to determin what is the utmoſt that is in the Power of Natural Cauſes, or Agents, to produce without Supernatural
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41777:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>Aſſiſtance, and what is the leaſt of thoſe that are to be eſteemed Supernatural Effects, and which ought to be aſcribed to a cauſe of Tranſcendent Power, this is a matter of great difficulty. But yet when ſuch things are done as were never heard of from the Foundation of the World, to be done by them that have made the greateſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of the ſtrength and operation of Natural Cauſes; yea, which have directly croſſed the courſe of Nature, without uſing any Natural Cauſes to oppoſe one another: I ſuppoſe that every rational man, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him abſurd that will deny theſe to be Miracles, and done by the immediate hand of God, except he can ſhew any Natural cauſe that ſhould be imagined to work theſe effects.</p>
                     <p>This we find our <hi>Saviour</hi> to ſtand much upon, when he was on Earth, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his being the true <hi>Meſſiah.
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.36.</note> I have a greater Witneſs, then that of</hi> John (though the <hi>Jews</hi> did moſt of them rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence him greatly for his ſtrict life) <hi>the works which my Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do, bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> And afterward,
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.25.</note> when the <hi>Jews</hi> asked Jeſus, to tell them plainly, whether he were the Meſſiah, he ſends them to his Works; <hi>The works that I do in my Fathers Name,
<note place="margin">Ver. 37, 38.</note> they bear witneſs of me:</hi> And further ſaith, <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41777:55"/>I do, though ye believe not me, yet believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.11.</note> 
                        <hi>Believe me that the Father is in me, and I in him, or elſe believe me for the very works ſake.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 15.24.</note> And again, <hi>If I had not done amongſt them the works, which no other man can do, they had not had ſin,</hi> (that is, their ſin had not been ſo great and inexcuſable) <hi>but now have they both ſeen and hated both me and my Father.</hi> Yea, he tells thoſe that were underſtanding perſons among them, that inaſmuch as they had refiſted and oppoſed that Doctrine which he had thus confirmed, and had imputed theſe works to the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<note place="margin">Matt. 12.28.</note> therefore they had ſinned that <hi>ſin againſt the holy Ghost, which ſhould never be forgiven.</hi> Thus you ſee that <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf laid great ſtreſs upon this Argument,
<note place="margin">Mark. 3.29.</note> to prove himſelf to be the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> becauſe he had done ſuch works to confirm this Truth, as no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man could do, yea ſuch as none but God himſelf could do.</p>
                     <p>And that Jeſus did work theſe Miracles to confirm the truth of his being the Meſſiah, may be ſufficiently evident, both by what hath been ſpoken already, and alſo by what he ſpake to the Diſciples of <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 11.4.</note> When their Maſter ſent them to him to be ſatisfied whether or no he were the true Meſſiah; he anſwers them, <hi>Go tell John the things that ye have ſeen and heard: The blind receive their ſight, the lame walk, the lepers
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41777:55"/>are cleanſed, the dead are raiſed up:</hi> And therefore do you judge who it is that hath power to do ſuch works as theſe.</p>
                     <p>It would be a large task to reckon up all the Miracles of Chriſt which are upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: I ſhall onely ſet before you ſome of thoſe which do moſt apparently ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be works peculiar to the Divine Power to effect.

                     <p>Beſides, the Miracles that Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41777:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>to have wrought were not done in a <hi>corner,</hi> nor a great while <hi>before</hi> they were written. He fed 5000 people at one time, and 4000 at another miraculouſly: yea, moſt of Chriſt Miracles were wrought <hi>openly,</hi> ſo that many of the Jews were preſent at the doing of them: and they were written in the <hi>ſame</hi> age wherein they were done: ſo that the unbelieving Jews, who were ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Jeſus, would certainly have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted them, if they had written an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>
                     <p>Yea, other Writers beſides the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts do mention theſe Miracles. See what teſtimony <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf, though a Jew,
<note place="margin">Joſeph <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> gives of Chriſt. <hi>At that time was Jeſus a wiſe man, if it be lawful to call him a man: for he was the performer of divers admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble works, and the instructor of thoſe who willingly entertain the truth: and he drew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him divers Jews and Greeks to be his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. This was Chriſt, who being accuſed by the Princes of the Nation before</hi> Pilate, <hi>and afterward condemned to the Croſs by him, yet did not they who followed him from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forbear to love him, for the ignoming of his death: for he appeared to them alive the third day after, according as the divine Prophets had before teſtified the ſame.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41777:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>works which he did, and withall the truth of his Doctrine, and certainty of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: And, which we may greatly wonder at, he who in flattery had before called <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Meſſiah, when he comes to write this Hiſtory (whether it overſlipped him, or whether it was forced from him by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling hand of God) he confeſſeth that this Jeſus was <hi>the Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, the <hi>Turks</hi> cannot but confeſs that Jeſus did very many great and wonderful works: and therefore they preferr him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſet him next to their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> and ſay, He was a good man and a <hi>great Prophet.</hi> And ſome of the Jews ſay that Jeſus was a very holy man, and highly in favour with God, who enabled him to do all theſe works: and yet they will not believe him to be the Meſſiah.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Evaſion,</hi> whereby ſome of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Jews, are ſaid to endeavour to keep off this Argument from the Miracles which Jeſus wrought, from convincing them that he was the true Meſſiah, is ſo abſurd, that the very mentioning of it, will proclaim it ridiculous. They ſay, that as to thoſe works which he did, he came to do them by this means: He got once into the <hi>Holy of holies,</hi> and ſtole out thence the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which was there written upon a Plate of Gold; and for fear leſt it ſhould be taken from him, he cut a hole in his Thigh, and put the Plate therein; and by vertue of that Name, they ſay he did all thoſe miracles: Every man will eaſily ſee the abſurdity of this, without my ſpending of words to confute it.</p>
                     <p>However, hereby it is evident, that men of all Nations and Profeſſions, are convinced of the many miracles which Jeſus wrought, when he was upon Earth: And foraſmuch as he wrought theſe on purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of his being the Meſſiah that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41777:58"/>was promiſed; we may therefore conclude that this Truth is hereby ſetled as ſuch a Rock, that the gates of Hell ſhall never be able to prevail againſt it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Argument,
<note n="2" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſhall be drawn from <hi>Jeſus his fulfilling all the Propheſies,</hi> that went before, concerning the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> All things did concur in his Perſon, which were foretold concerning the Perſon of the Meſſiah, and all things were done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by him, that were foretold to be done and ſuffered by the Meſſiah, and therefore he was the true Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>This was another great Argument which Jeſus himſelf uſed; <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are thoſe that teſtifie of me.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 5.39.</note> And tells them, that if they did not ſhut their eyes, they might plainly ſee all things ſo exactly fulfilled in him, that, if they did not believe in him,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 45, 46, 47.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes himſelf would bear witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: For if they had believed</hi> Moſes <hi>writings,</hi> and rightly underſtood them, <hi>they would have believed Jeſus to be the Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So when Jeſus, after his Reſurrection, was going with the two Diſciples to <hi>Emmaus,
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.25, 26, 27.</note> he began at</hi> Moſes, <hi>and ſo, through all the Prophets, expounded unto them thoſe things which were written concerning himſelf;</hi> and blames them for that they had ſearched and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the writing of the Prophets no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<note place="margin">Acts 17.2, 3.</note> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> entered into the Synagogue three Sabbath dayes, <hi>And reaſoned with them out of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41777:58"/>Scriptures, opening and alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered, and riſen again from the dead, and that this Jeſus whom I preach unto you, is Chriſt.</hi> And again, it is ſaid elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Acts 18.28.</note> that St. <hi>Paul mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, ſhewing by the Scriptures, that Jeſus is Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is very obſervable, that the Evangeliſts in relating many of the paſſages of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours life, do refer to the Propheſies that foretold theſe things. This, and <hi>This was done that it might be fulfilled, which was ſpoken by</hi> this and the other <hi>Prophet,</hi> and <hi>then was fulfilled the ſaying of the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.44.</note> So Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith, <hi>Theſe are the words that I ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you while I was yet with you, that all things muſt be fulfilled, which are written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms, concerning me.</hi> Yea, he was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in accompliſhing all the Propheſies, that when he was upon the Croſs, in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of pain, and knew that all things were fulfilled, ſave only that one Propheſie, which foretold that they ſhould <hi>give, him Vinegar to drink,</hi> he therefore gives occaſion for the fulfilling of it, before he would die;
<note place="margin">John 19.28. Verſ. 30.</note> and when that was done, he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and then gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Now that we may be the more ſenſible how Jeſus did fulfil all the Propheſies that went before, concerning the Meſſiah, let us conſider it in theſe ſeveral Branches.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was foretold, that the Meſſiah ſhould
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41777:59"/>ſpring from the <hi>Loyns of Abraham,</hi> and in the Line of the <hi>Houſe of David, Gen.</hi> 22.18. and Chap. 49.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1. Now this was exactly fulfilled, as we ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. where the Pedegree is traced up to <hi>David,</hi> and thence to <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Abraham:</hi> And for this very purpoſe, we may conceive theſe Genealogies to be ſet down, even to ſatisfie us, that Jeſus came of theſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as it had been foretold concerning him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was foretold, that he ſhould be <hi>born of</hi> a Virgin;
<note place="margin">Iſa 7.14.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son,</hi> &amp;c. The Jews of late have endeavoured to evade the force of this Text, by corrupting it; telling us that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which we render, <hi>a Virgin,</hi> doth onely ſignifie <hi>a Woman;</hi> but this, as it doth offer great violence to the word here uſed, ſo alſo to the ſcope of the Text, and Context. For the words are ſpoken as a <hi>ſigne</hi> to <hi>Ahaz;</hi> Now what ſigne or wonder would it have been, to tell them that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould conceive or bear a Son? But for a Virgin to conceive, and yet continue a Virgin ſtill, that is a wonder, and fit to be given as a Signe. Now this alſo was fulfilled in that Jeſus, in whom we believe as the Scripture ſhew.
<note place="margin">Mat. 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>The Angel of God came to a Virgin, whoſe name was Mary,</hi> and told her, <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt conceive in thy Womb,</hi> &amp;c. and when She asked,

                        <hi>How can this be? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I know not a man.</hi> It was anſwered, <hi>The

                     <p n="3">3. The Meſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>though thou be mean amongſt the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>yet out of thee ſhall he come forth, who ſhall be Ruler of my people.</hi> The Jews were ſenſible of this, and therefore the Scribes and Elders, directed the <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> thither,
<note place="margin">Mat. 2. Luk. 2.</note> and cite this place of the Prophet for it. Now Jeſus was born there; and it is the more obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe of that Providence which brought <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the bleſſed Virgin hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any thoughts of him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them thither.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It was foretold, that the Meſſiah ſhould have <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> to go before him. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will ſend my Meſſenger before thy face,
<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> which ſhall prepare thy way before thee;</hi> and then, <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come into his Temple.</hi> And elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.3.</note> he is called <hi>the Voice of one crying in the Wilderneſs, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</hi> Now Jeſus in whom we believe, had <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt to be born ſix months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him;
<note place="margin">Luk. 1. Mal. 3.</note> and he is ſaid to begin a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus began to Preach, and he Taught in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judea,</hi> the Baptiſm of Repentance, for the Remiſſion of ſin.
<note place="margin">Mark 1.1, 2.</note> And it is obſervable how St. <hi>Mark</hi> begins his Goſpel, as it were taking at theſe Propheſies of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Malachy, The beginning of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41777:60"/>Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, as it is written in the Prophets, Behold I ſend my meſſenger before thy face,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Prophet fortold that when the Meſſiah ſhould come, he ſhould confirm his Doctrine by many and great Miracles. <hi>Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 35.5, 6.</note> and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped: then ſhall the lame man leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing.</hi> Now Jeſus did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Doctrine with theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracles, as I have ſhewed. But to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Miracles particularly to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; He opened the eyes of <hi>the blind, Matt.</hi> 9.27. he unſtopped the ears of <hi>the deaf, Mar.</hi> 7.32. he made the lame <hi>to walk, Matt.</hi> 15.30. and the dumb <hi>to ſpeak, Matt.</hi> 9.32.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It was foretold that the Meſſiah ſhould enter into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a kinde of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant manner. That they ſhould cry to him <hi>Hoſanna,
<note place="margin">Zech. 9.9. Pſal. 118.25, 26.</note> Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> For the word <hi>Hoſanna</hi> ſignifies <hi>Save we beſeech thee,</hi> and in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of that place of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the word <hi>Hoſanna</hi> is uſed. And this alſo was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Jeſus Chriſt, as you may ſee at large, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It was foretold that he ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by one of his own Servants. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his own perſon ſpeaketh,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.9.</note> 
                        <hi>Yea, mine own familiar friend in whom I truſted, who did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<note place="margin">Mat. 26.14, 15.</note> and I will deliver him unto you? and they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with him for thirty pieces of ſilver:</hi> with which, after <hi>Judas</hi> in remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had reſtored it,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.7, 8, 9.</note> they conſulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and <hi>bought the Potters field to bury ſtrangers in.</hi> And whereas there may be ſome ſcruple here, in that the Greek cites <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet, when the words are not to be found in him, but in <hi>Zechariah:</hi> for the reſolving of this, ſee <hi>Junius in Parallelis,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hammon in loc.</hi> and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. It was foretold that the Meſſiah ſhould ſuffer death,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.12 <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</note> that he ſhould <hi>pour out his ſoul unto death,</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>numbred with tranſgreſſors:</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>ſcourged,</hi> to the end,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.17.</note> that <hi>by his ſtripes we might be healed.</hi> That he ſhould be crucified, <hi>I may tell all my bones, they look and ſtare upon me:</hi> this crucifying was ſuch a torment as did, as it were, put all his bones out of joynt. That he ſhould be <hi>mocked</hi> by his enemies, as he hanged upon the Croſs.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.8. Pſa. 69.21. Pſal. 22.19.</note> That he ſhould have <hi>vinegar</hi> mingled with gall given him to drink. That they ſhould <hi>divide</hi> his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among them, and caſt <hi>lots</hi> upon his Veſture. Now theſe things were all fulfilled
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41777:61"/>in Jeſus Chriſt: as we may ſee if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the ſtory of his death in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and in particular, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.15, 26, 34, 35, 38, 39.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It was foretold that the Meſſiah ſhould riſe again from the dead the third day. That <hi>when he had made his ſoul an offering for ſin,
<note place="margin">Iſa, 53.11.</note> he ſhould ſee his ſeed and prolong his days.</hi> And ſome take thoſe words in <hi>Hoſea</hi> to foretel his riſing the third day,

                        <hi>After two days he will revive us, and the third day we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi> That he ſhould aſcend into Heaven,

                        <hi>Thou hast aſcended on high, thou haſt led captivity captive; and received gifts for men.</hi> And ſome take that other place to be a propheſie of the ſame,

                        <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye ever laſting doors, and the King of glory ſhall come in.</hi> Now this alſo was fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Matt. 28.1.</note> who roſe again from the dead the third day: and aſcended into heaven before divers witneſſes.
<note place="margin">Mar. 16.19.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it was foretold that the Meſliah ſhould be <hi>God as well as Man,</hi> as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fully before,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> by thoſe Names that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him. Now Jeſus in whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as he was evident to all that knew him, to be truely man; ſo is he affirmed to be <hi>over all God bleſſed for ever:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5.9</note> to be <hi>Davids Son,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 22.42.</note> and <hi>Davids Lord</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>There were alſo ſome other things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told concerning the Meſſiah. As that he ſhould call the Gentiles, enter into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41777:61"/>Temple, ruine the Idols of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, ſilence their Oracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of theſe I have ſpoken in the laſt Chapter. Alſo there are ſome leſſer matters as that he ſhould be called a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> that he ſhould be brought up and preach in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and the like. But theſe things which I have mentioned, are ſome of the chief things that are contained in the Propheſies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>To ſum up therefore the Argument: If all things that were foretold concerning the perſon of the Meſſiah, or concerning what he ſhould do and ſuffer upon earth, did concur in that <hi>Jeſus</hi> in whom we believe, then may we conclude him to be the true <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> But all things did concur in his perſon as to his Conception, Birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all things were done and ſuffered by him, which the Prophers foretold concerning the Meſſiah: Therefore we may undoubtedly believe, that the ſame Jeſils in whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is the true Meſſiah, who was promiſed to come into the world.</p>

                     <p>WE have proceeded ſo far, as to ſhew evident proof of theſe truths: that the Son of God was promiſed to the fathers of the Old Teſtament, to take our Nature upon him, and to become our Saviour: and that the time for the fulfilling of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yea, the ſet time is long ſince come: and withal that the ſame Jeſus in whom we believe, is that very Meſſiah who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the fathers.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41777:63"/>an Angel ſaith unto the Women, that Chriſt who was crucified was <hi>riſen up again;</hi>

So that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Angels witneſs him to be truely God and truely Man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We have the teſtimony of many Pious Perſons in the New Teſtament: which, though to a Jew or Heathen it be of little value, yet to all that profeſs obedience to the holy Scriptures, it is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let us ſee the confeſſion of <hi>Zachary:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 1.68.</note> He calls him <hi>the Lord God of Iſrael who had viſited his people</hi> ſo as to <hi>Redeem</hi> them: a clear teſtimony of both his Natures.

                        <hi>The mother of her Lord.</hi> And the Bleſſed Virgin her ſelf calls him that was conceived in her Womb, <hi>The Lord her Sauiour:</hi> a clear proof of his two Natures.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gives teſtimony to this: whoſe teſtimony may well be reckoned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly from other Saints, becauſe he was ſent eſpecially about this Meſſage, to bear witneſs of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.29.</note> He calls him <hi>The Lamb
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41777:64"/>of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world:</hi> Here he gives Teſtimony both to his Divinity, in that he was able to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Gods juſtice, and to take away ſin; and to his Humanity, in that he was a Lamb that had a body to ſacrifice; and to the end of his coming into the world, <hi>viz.</hi> to take away the ſins thereof.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The greateſt and moſt Authentick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that can be defired or imagined, is that of the Father from Heaven concerning him: <hi>This is my well beloved Son,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17. Chap. 17.5.</note> in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> That he was truly man, was evident to thoſe that were about him; that he was God, was evident by the Teſtimony of God himſelf, who is the God of Truth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The paſſages of his life upon Earth, doth ſhew him to be both truly God and truly Man. His <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirſting,</hi> his <hi>wearineſs</hi> and <hi>faintneſs,</hi> his <hi>ſighing</hi> and <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and ſuch other fruits of humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, were ſufficient Arguments to prove him to be <hi>truly man.</hi> And all the <hi>miraculous</hi> works of his Power, which he wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth (of which I have ſpoken before) as they ſhew him to be the Meſſiah,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 35.5, 6.</note> that was foretold by the Prophets; of whom it was foretold that he ſhould work ſuch miracles; ſo alſo that he was <hi>truly God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 5.36</note> as himſelf argues.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Teſtimony of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, doth confirm this: Of St. <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. Chap. 3.17, 18.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41777:64"/>and Chap. 4.11, 12. and Chap. 10.43. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. Of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9.22. and Chap. 13.23, 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. Of St <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 2.22. and Chap. 5.2, 15. Of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Proto-martyr, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.52. Of St. <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8.32. And many more Inſtances of this ſort might be alledged, but theſe are ſome of the chief.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The general <hi>conſent</hi> of the Catholick Church of Chriſt in all Ages, ever ſince the time of Jeſus and his Apoſtles, who have held this Truth, and made it a main Article of all their Creeds: The concurrence of all Pious and Orthodox <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> beſide the chearful and undaunted ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of many thouſands of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> for the Profeſſion of this Faith: This, I ſay, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the former Teſtimonies, do argue this foundation of our Faith, to be laid as ſo ſure a Rock, that <hi>The gates of Hell,
<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.</note> ſhall never be able to prevail againſt it:</hi> and that we may comfortably venture our ſelves upon this Truth, that the ſame Jeſus in whom we believe, is both <hi>Lord and Chriſt, God and Man, Hypoſtatically united.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let us proceed to the other Head, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that, Chriſt did fully, and in a true and proper ſenſe, make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Gods juſtice for our ſins: And that; Salvation is to be expected from, him and no other way.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is very evident that the Apoſtles, in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41777:65"/>the New Teſtament, do affirm us to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi> to God, and <hi>juſtified</hi> in his fight, by the merits and ſufferings of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> 
                        <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Which as it ſhews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there was an <hi>enmity</hi> between God and man through the Fall, and this enmity mutual: God offended by mens tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and man alienated from God, by the depravation of his Nature: So it ſhews whereby the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> was wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, even by the death of Chriſt the Son of God; who did both by the merits of his death, ſatisfie Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and alſo by the efficacy of his Death, and Reſurrection, take from us the ſtony heart, and give us an heart of fleſh. And it is very obſervable,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> how afterward the Apoſtle makes a direct <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> between the firſt and the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> the miſery that befel us by the tranſgreſſion of the firſt, and the benefits we receive by the obedience and ſufferings of the latter: <hi>As by one mans diſebedience, many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Which words as they do ſuppoſe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to all his poſterity, whereby they are ſaid to be made ſinners, and liable to Gods juſtice: So they do plainly expreſs the benefits of Chriſt's death, to be communicated to the juſtification of as many as do believe in him; And what can be a plainer proof of the point in hand?</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:41777:65"/>
                     <p>Secondly, The New Teſtament ſpeaks of the blood of Chriſt, being ſhed to make an <hi>attonement</hi> for us.
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>Being found in faſhion of a man,</hi> having taken our Nature upon him and ſet himſelf in our ſtead, in this nature and in our ſtead, <hi>He humbled himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> And, that we may know that he died for us, &amp; ſhed his blood to make attonement to Divine Juſtice for our ſins;
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7.</note> St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>That the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> cleanſeth us from all our ſins;</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That by his ſtripes, we are healed:</hi> Not healed only in a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, as good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples tend to heal and take away corrupt manners: as if Chriſt had come into the world, onely to give us an example of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in his life, and of Humility and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at his death, and that were all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which we were to expect by him: But we are ſo healed by his ſtripes, that our ſins are thereby <hi>pardoned,</hi> being puniſhed on his back: He <hi>ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt,</hi> to the end that he might juſtifie the ungodly that believe in him: So himſelf tells us,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.20.</note> that <hi>his blood was ſhed for many, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</hi> He died that he might purchaſe at Gods hands, the pardon of our ſins, by undergoing that puniſhment which we had deſerved. To this agrees that Character which the Baptiſt gives of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.29</note> 
                        <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> This ſheweth plainly that he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41777:66"/>was ſlain, and offered up as a Propitiatory ſacrifice, to expiate the guilt of our ſins.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The New Teſtament ſets him forth as the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of all the Legal purifications, and ceremonial Oblations, and Expiations which were uſed by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And this argues, that he made an Attonement for us. Certainly the great God of Heaven and Earth, did not take their Cattel from the Jews, becauſe he had need of them, or becauſe he delighted in ſhedding the blood of innocent Beaſts, that were no wayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſins of their Maſters: But we have reaſon to believe, there were further matters intended by theſe Ceremonies of the Law. God did appoint theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial waſhings, and expiations, after legal defilements, that the people might be put in mind of the <hi>defiling</hi> nature of ſin, and might be warned to take heed of it, as that which defiles the ſoul, and accordingly might endeavour, after they had fallen into it, to waſh their ſouls with tears of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Contrition. He charged their Eſtates, and cauſed them to ſacrifice their Cattel, that they might learn, that Sin is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to God, and did expoſe them to that, and a worſe death then the innocent beaſt did ſuſtain: And yet further, to put them in mind, <hi>that without ſhedding of blood,</hi> the blood of Chriſt the Lamb of God, <hi>there could be no remiſſion of ſin obtained:</hi> And that their laying their <hi>hand</hi> upon the ſacrifice
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41777:66"/>that was offered up for them, might ſtir them up to put forth an hand of <hi>Faith,</hi> to lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt: And by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bodies in water, they might be put in mind,
<note place="margin">Zech. 13.1.</note> to apply themſelves to that <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſet open for Judah and Jeruſalem to waſh in, for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this was the ſignification of their ceremonial Cleanſings, and Expiations, and that Chriſt by the ſheding of his blood, did accompliſh that for us really and effectually, which was ſhaddowed in theſe Ceremonies, is very evident in that of the Apoſtle:
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.12.</note> 
                        <hi>Not by the blood of Calves or Goats,</hi> (as the high Prieſt amongſt the Jews, was wont to enter into the moſt holy Place) <hi>but by his own blood he entred once into the holy Place, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal Redemption for us.</hi> Hence he ſheweth the excellency of Chriſt's ſacrifice, beyond thoſe Typical ſacrifices: Thoſe Prieſts offered <hi>often,</hi> He offered but <hi>once;</hi> they entred into the holy Place made <hi>with</hi> hands, He into the holy Place made <hi>without</hi> hands, even into Heaven; whither he went as our Head, to prepare a place for us, and to ſhew that he had purchaſed eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us, and an intereſt in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which he went to take poſſeſſion of for us. And he goes on to argue, <hi>à fortiori,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> If the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, did ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the purifying of the fleſh,</hi> in a legal ſenſe;
<note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> then <hi>how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:41777:67"/>&amp;c? Seeing the Sacrifice which Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was of infinit value, as being offered up by the Eternal Spirit, or Divine Nature, which was Hypoſtatically united to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; it is therefore ſufficient to make a full and perfect Attonement for us. And further,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>For this cauſe he is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Teſtament, that by means of death, for the Redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſhews very evidently, that Chriſt was the thing intended by thoſe ceremonial Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that his blood did that in a real and effectual manner, which thoſe ſacrifices did Legally and Typically; and withal that his death was intended purpoſely for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Tranſgreſſions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> that, <hi>Christ hath delivered us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> He was ſubject to that accurſed death, and to the wrath of God for the preſent; for this end, that he might deliver us from this wrath and curſe of God, and from that eternal death, which our ſins had made us liable unto. There was no reaſon for Chriſts ſuffering as to any thing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.22. Verſ. 24.</note> For, <hi>He had done no evil, neither was any guile found in his mouth;</hi> but he <hi>bare our ſins in his body upon that Tree,</hi> whereon he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that ſhameful, painful, and accurſed death.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Apoſtles do plainly pronounce that we are <hi>redeemed</hi> by the death of Chriſt.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41777:67"/>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24, 25.</note> 
                        <hi>We are juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a propitiation through Faith in his blood:</hi> Here the Apoſtle doth expreſly ſay, that Chriſt is a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us, and ſhews us that the onely way to have our ſins pardoned, is by Faith in his blood. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.18, 19.</note> 
                        <hi>We are redeemed, not with corruptible things, as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, but with the moſt precious blood of Chriſt, that Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh.</hi> To which agrees that of St. <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> He is made of God to us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption:</hi> And again,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20. 2 Pet. 2.1. 1 Tim. 2.5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>We are bought with a price.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls Chriſt, <hi>The Lord that bought us.</hi> So elſewhere it is ſaid, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediatour between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a ranſom for us:</hi> To this agrees that,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.14.</note> 
                        <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> And further,
<note place="margin">chap. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>The Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing that was against us, is ſaid to be nailed to his Croſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> for us, which we could not obtain by the <hi>works</hi> of the Law, that is, by our own perſonal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God. If man had from his firſt Creation continued in perfect obedience to the Law of his Creator, there would have been no need of Chriſts dying:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41777:68"/>But man had ſinned and come ſhort of this Obedience, and therefore Chriſt died, to expiate this guilt which we had contracted by our diſobedience:
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.21.</note> 
                        <hi>If righteouſneſs come by the Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>then Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain:</hi> There would have been no need of Chriſts death, if man could have been righteous by his own good works; but Chriſt therefore died, becauſe we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned before God, and he took our guilt upon him:
<note place="margin">Acts 13.39.</note> And, By <hi>him all that believe are juſtified from all thoſe things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of</hi> Moſes; <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman,

                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Apoſtles tell us, That whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chriſt did or ſuffered, it was for our <hi>ſakes,</hi> and to purchaſe <hi>Reconciliation</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> for us.
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> 
                        <hi>He was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification;</hi> and our ſins are ſaid <hi>to be forgiven us,

                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe and many other Teſtimonies of the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt, it is ſufficiently evident to every man whoſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41777:68"/>eyes are not blinded by the <hi>God of this world,</hi> that Chriſt did offer up himſelf an <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> ſacrifice for our ſins; and that through his Merits, and Sufferings alone it is, that we obtain the forgiveneſs of our ſins, and eternal Salvation.</p>

The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who though they have deviſed many Ceremonies and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental expreſſions of honour unto Chriſt in their way of Worſhip, yet are found to betray him in their Doctrine, while they ſalute him with ſo many <hi>Ave's.</hi> There are <hi>two</hi> Points of Popery, which are deteſtable to every true Chriſtian, as having an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tendency to draw men off from that honour which they owe to Chriſts Merits, and that truſt which they ought to repoſe in Him alone.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>adoration and invocation of Saints departed.</hi> To omit their Canonizing of thoſe for Saints, that either had never any other place but in the Popiſh Calendars; their Utopian Saints, as <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and ſuch like: as alſo thoſe who though they have lived upon earth, yet it may juſtly be ſuſpected they never lived in Heaven; their Prophane and traiterous Saints, their <hi>Becket,</hi> and <hi>Faux,</hi> &amp;c. And
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41777:69"/>yet this tends much to render their Religion ridiculous, that they ſhould undertake to make them Saints that were either no men or no honeſt men; and expect help from thoſe that ſtand in need of help themſelves, though it ſhall never be afforded them. To omit this, I ſay that the Divine Worſhip, which they beſtow upon the beſt and moſt undoubted Saints, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts;</hi> yea, or the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> her ſelf, is no better than groſs Idolatry. We reverence <hi>the Mother of our Saviour,</hi> inaſmuch as <hi>He that is Mighty hath magnified her,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we and all generations do deſervedly call her Bleſſed.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 1.48, 49.</note> We honour the memory of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in Heaven, and thoſe dayes which our Church appoints annually for keeping up the remembrance of them, do put us in minde to bleſs God for his Graces beſtowed on them, and the benefits which we may hope to receive both by their Doctrine and Examples. But to give Divine Honour to any of theſe, ſo as to worſhip them or invocate their help, either as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>donors,</hi> or yet as <hi>interceſſours;</hi> we believe to be as palpable idolatry, as to worſhip any of the Heathen gods. And certainly if the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> and the other <hi>Saints</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were capable of underſtanding the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious vanity of thoſe that worſhip them, and of communicating their mindes to us on earth, they would declare their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt abhorrency and <hi>deteſtation</hi> of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41777:70"/>honour which is given them. Beſide, is it not groſs <hi>Sottiſhneſs</hi> for men to believe that their whiſpers ſhould be heard by the Saints in Heaven, and the whiſpers of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands as may be conceived to be praying to one Saint at the ſame time; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they can either ſhew ſome reaſon that perſwades them to this belief, or elſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that ſuch prayers ſhould be heard? And what can be more evident then the <hi>wrong</hi> that is done to Jeſus Chriſt, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting many mediatours of Interceſſion, as if himſelf were either not <hi>able</hi> or not <hi>at leaſure</hi> to receive all the petitions that are put up to him at the ſame time, or elſe had not ſo much <hi>goodneſs</hi> and compaſſion in him towards his people, as the Saints have, which ſhould make us to expect a ſpeedier redreſs, by calling upon them then by calling upon himſelf? The Apoſtle tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Tim 2.5.</note> that <hi>There is but one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour between God and man, the man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> And as the owning or worſhipping of more gods then one, is as abſurd and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to worſhip none at all; ſo the owning or invocating more then one Mediatour, is an high wrong to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our onely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Advocate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Doctrine of <hi>Merits</hi> doth lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother foundation beſide Jeſus Chriſt. When they teach a Merit either of <hi>condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> or yet of <hi>congruity</hi> in our good Works; yea, are ſo ſuper-arrogant as to teach their
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41777:70"/>Doctrine of <hi>ſupererogation:</hi> A monſtrous term, invented to expreſs a monſtrous Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Divinity: and that which doth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently tend to draw men off from building their Faith wholly upon the foundation of Chriſts Merits, and to part the glory of their Salvation between him and the Saints departed.

                     <p>Secondly, ſome <hi>new Projectors</hi> amongſt us, who if they did terminate their ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within the compaſs of Philoſophical points, we would eaſily allow them to make themſelves proud with conceiting that they have found out a device to ſee further into a Milſtone then their poor blind Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                     <p>How happy did the <hi>Protoplaſts</hi> conceit themſelves, when they thought of being like God to know both good and evil? and how great happineſs do many conceit in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41777:71"/>attempting ſuch a ſcutiny into every thing, that not only Nature, but Religion alſo muſt diſcover all its ſecrets to their refined reaſon? When theſe perſons have firſt performed ſuch wonders in <hi>Nature,</hi> as to graſp all the Air that incircles the Earth in their fiſt, or to embrace Heaven in their arms, or to lade the Ocean dry with a Nut-ſhell; then we ſhall believe that the vaſtneſs of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may not onely comprehend thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Faith,</hi> which we poor Mortals have admired for ſo many ages; but alſo perfect their devices for climbing up to the <hi>Lunar Orbe,</hi> and examine the Religion that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed there. But they might do well, firſt to diſcover the <hi>contradictions</hi> that are to be met with, in the old. Syſtems of Divinity, and that by men that have ſo much <hi>ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> as to underſtand them in a competent and candid manner: and next to <hi>reconcile</hi> the contradictions which are ſo palpable in ſome of their <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> (by name that which ſuppoſeth the <hi>Eternity of the World</hi>) and then to begin to apply their Engines to work ſtrange feats, when they have found them ſit to bear the cenſure of the world. Theſe attempts, if they have not diſpoſed the <hi>Authors</hi> of them, yet I fear they will prepare many of the <hi>Readers</hi> and admirers of them, to be firſt <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> then <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and in concluſion <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, another ſort are they who (to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41777:71"/>give them a Name neareſt relating to their principal Tenet, or rather pretence) may be termed <hi>Illuminati.</hi> Thoſe that pretend to ſuch a <hi>light within,</hi> as ſhould be ſufficient to lead them to Heaven, if they walk anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to it. I would willingly know of theſe pretenders, what they underſtand this <hi>light</hi> to be? Is it <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or is it ſomething elſe? If they ſay, It is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom we have ſhewed to be God and Man hypoſtatically united; then how near do they ſymbolize with the <hi>Papists</hi> in their Doctrine of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity</hi> of Chriſt, and their Capernaitical conceit of a groſs eating of Chriſts Body by the moſt wicked man, that partakes of the Elements in the <hi>Euchariſt?</hi> Seeing this Tenet would both ſuppoſe Chriſts Perſon to be <hi>every where,</hi> and alſo to have his abode in the <hi>vilest</hi> of men, as well as in the beſt. But if they ſay, It is ſomething elſe then Chriſt, I ask then, What it is? Is it that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which Chriſt before he left the world, promiſed to ſend? Or is it onely the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light of Reaſon and Conſcience, which are the remainders of that Law of God, which was written upon Mans heart in his Creation, but ſadly defaced by the Fall? If they ſay that it is that <hi>Spirit</hi> which Chriſt promiſed to ſend after his Aſcenſion: We muſt deſire them to take notice, that in this Promiſe there was ſomething? peculiar to the Apoſtles and others that were to be ſent abroad to preach the Goſpel in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41777:72"/>of the planting of Chriſtianity: ſome things that have reſpect to all Believers in all ſucceeding ages of the Church: and others, that were common to all the World. It was peculiarly promiſed and fulfilled to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſome others that were to be employed in planting the Goſpel at firſt, to have the Holy Ghoſt given them to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to work <hi>Miracles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 1.8.</note> and to ſpeak with divers <hi>tongues</hi> for the confirmation of the Doctrine which they taught: and this, I ſuppoſe, they cannot themſelves believe to be in every man that comes into the World, nor yet in every man that talks of God and pretends to <hi>this light:</hi> If they do, let them ſhew it by working of Miracles, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſtrange Tongues. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>all Believers</hi> that this Holy Spirit ſhould be a <hi>Comforter</hi> to them,
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.26.</note> and withal a <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> to teach them, &amp; bring to their memories the things which Chriſt had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but in this ſenſe alſo, they cannot but confeſs that <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> is onely given to the <hi>children of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note> It was more <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> promiſed that this Spirit of God in the Miniſtry of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours,</hi> who ſhould be fitted for and aſſiſted in their Miniſtry by this Spirit, ſhould <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of ſin,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.8</note> of righteouſneſs, and of judgement:</hi> but what is this to ſuch an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> teaching as they conceive to be in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man from this <hi>light within?</hi> But then if they ſay, It is the <hi>Light of reaſon and natural
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41777:72"/>conſcience,</hi> as we confeſs this to be in every man, and that even the worſt of men, the Heathens themſelves, have that within them which doth teſtifie againſt their groſly lewd and vicious courſes, and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> and condemn them when they have done ſuch things;
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15.</note> and withall doth <hi>excuſe</hi> and encourage them when they have done that which is <hi>good:</hi> ſo we muſt needs add, that this light is far from being <hi>ſufficient</hi> to lead men to Heaven. I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> how far the <hi>light of nature</hi> will guide us, and how far it will leave us ſhort of Heaven, if it be not helped by a better light. And I may here ſay further, that this light of Nature is ſo far vitiated by the Fall, that the Scripture doth frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſtate of a man in his natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to be an <hi>eſtate of darkneſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5.8. Act. 26.18.</note> and the regeneration of a ſoul to be a <hi>turning it from darkneſs to light.</hi> If then <hi>the light that is in man be darkneſs,</hi> how ſhould it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to lead him to Heaven without a better guide?</p>
                     <p>But how do they mean that this light within is ſufficient to lead a man to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Is it ſo ſufficient, that there is no need of <hi>Laws or Government to puniſh evil doers, and to encourage them that do well?</hi> Is it ſo ſufficient, that we have no need of the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word of God, or to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the dictates of that <hi>light without?</hi> Is it ſo ſufficient, that a man by walking up to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41777:73"/>it may attain Heaven by a <hi>righteouſneſs of his own,</hi> ſo as not to ſtand in need of the help of a <hi>crucified Jeſus,</hi> either for the pardon of <hi>actual</hi> ſin, and much leſs of <hi>original,</hi> which perſons of theſe Principles do ſeem to <hi>diſown?</hi> This we have ſad reaſon to ſuſpect to be the tendency of this <hi>dark</hi> Tenet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>light within,</hi> and that which the Authors and divulgers of this Opinion do aim at: for otherwiſe they bring to light nothing extraordinary in it, and therefore ſpend a great deal of pains and ill-compoſed Zeal in oppoſing thoſe who taught them this very thing,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.9.</note> that <hi>Chriſt is the true Light that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mal. 4.1.</note> that he is that <hi>Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is ariſen upon the earth with healing in his wings:</hi> that there is ſufficient light in him to enlighten the darkneſs of our ſouls: that what light ſoever is in any man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of <hi>Nature</hi> or the other of <hi>Grace,</hi> it comes from him: and moreover that there is in every man that cometh into the world the <hi>light of nature,</hi> and the remainders of that Law which was written upon mans heart at firſt, not quite obliterated, by the Fall. Theſe things; I ſay, we taught them, and wherefore do they ſet up this as the principle wherein they <hi>differ</hi> from us and <hi>oppoſe</hi> us, if they mean no more than this in the plain and true ſenſe of it? But it is too ſadly evident that thoſe that are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of them have a further meaning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41777:73"/>a denying of a <hi>crucified Chriſt,</hi> and ſetting up a <hi>righteouſneſs of their own,</hi> though the poor deceived ones that follow the glorious blaze of this <hi>new light,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> do not underſtand theſe <hi>depths of Satan,</hi> and I wiſh they never may underſtand them ſo as to own them. <hi>Woe to him that ſtumbles at this ſtone.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.22.</note> Who is a lyar, but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt: he is Antichriſt that denieth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, as we ſhould all take heed that we keep cloſe to this one Foundation, ſo alſo we ſhould have a care <hi>what we build upon this foundation.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.12, 13.</note> that there are ſome who build upon it <hi>Gold, Silver, and precious Stones,</hi> ſound and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox principles of Faith; and theſe ſhall receive a reward when their works come to be tried and approved. But others build <hi>Wood, Hay, Stubble,</hi> groſs and unſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; and theſe, though they ſhall be ſaved in the day of Chriſt, ſo long as they hold faſt the Foundation, yet when their works come to be tried in the fire, <hi>they ſhall ſuffer loſs, but themſelves ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi> It is good when men hold faſt the Foundation: though they err in leſs matters, the Lord will take occaſion in his good time to convince them, and bring them to Heaven at laſt: but it is better not onely to lay a good Foundation, but alſo to build a good ſuperſtructure upon it.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41777:74"/>There are two ſorts of had <hi>ſuperſtructures</hi> which many build even upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt crucified.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are ſome who encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>looſneſs</hi> and <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi> in their practice, from the conſideration of the <hi>Grace of God in Chriſt.</hi> It is very certain that the Mercy of God and the Merits of Chriſt, are not onely very great, but infinitely beyond all that we can ſpeak or think of them. But yet <hi>the mercy and the truth of God</hi> are joyned together:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.10.</note> And as he hath ſaid that <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall finde mercy;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note> and he will be ſure to make this good:
<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> there was never any that <hi>came to him weary and heavy laden, but he did give him reſt:</hi> So on the other hand, he hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>wound the head of his enemies,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.21.</note> and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goeth on still in his treſpaſſes:</hi> and therefore thoſe that make this bad uſe of the free and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel, and thoſe inſtances that the Scriptures ſhew us of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercy of God to ſinners, do both wrong and deceive their own ſouls, and alſo they injure the great Mercy of God in Chriſt while they ſeem to advance it. His name was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he ſhould <hi>ſave his people from their ſins,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.21.</note> not <hi>in</hi> them. And <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bore our ſins in his own Body upon the Croſs, to the end that we being dead unto ſin, might live unto righteouſneſs,</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41777:74"/>healed.</hi> This then is one ſort of them that build. <hi>Hay and ſtubble</hi> upon this pretious Foundation: and though God may in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſave ſuch perſons, yet it will be <hi>as by fire;</hi> ſuch muſt expect to be brought unto great humiliation and brokenneſs of heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they finde aſſurance of Gods Mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There are others, who though they hold faſt the Foundation of the Chriſtian Faith, yet build upon it many <hi>erronious concluſions,</hi> in matters further off from the Foundation. Indeed it is the Duty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian to bear with many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miſtakes in his brother, whom he findes to be ſound in the main, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf alſo to be a man. But no man ought to indulge himſelf in an errour: both becauſe errour perſiſted in with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obſtinacy, is to be accounted rather a ſin of <hi>preſumption</hi> than infirmity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all becauſe of the dangerous tendency of errours, of which I ſpake before.
<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> Such a perſon who is ſound in fundamentals, doubtleſs God will not charge upon him to his condemnation miſtakes in ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but yet his <hi>works ſhall ſuffer loſs, and himſelf ſhall be ſaved as by fire;</hi> he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to paſs through convictions and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart before he come to Heaven And therefore as every good Chriſtian ſhould make it his firſt care to hold faſt the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith, ſo he ſhould not neglect due care of his ſuperſtructures, that he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41777:75"/>build nothing upon this pretious Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that may be unſuitable or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the foundation upon which it is built.</p>

He that can either ſhew me a <hi>Command</hi> to ſeparate from every Church, where there is any corruption; or <hi>produce</hi> me any Church of God ſince Chriſts time, which hath not had ſome ſpots in it; or elſe <hi>convince</hi> me that the ſociety with which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is joyned, is free from ſin: I will readily <hi>excuſe</hi> him in his Separation.

                     <p>Certainly,
<note place="margin">Rom 2.27.</note> what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> may be ſaid of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> to the Chriſtians. <hi>It profiteth us great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we keep the Law,</hi> if we lead lives an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to our Baptiſmal vow and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: <hi>but if not, it will be all one as if we had not been baptized;</hi> Yea, it will riſe up againſt us at the laſt day, and aggravate our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let me further admoniſh thoſe that are ſound in the Faith, that they <hi>ſtagger</hi> not in their Profeſſion, nor be induced to a love of Errors, through the <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> of the lives of thoſe that are Erronious. Indeed, there is ſo little ſhew of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or plain <hi>Scripture,</hi> for moſt things in which our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries differ from us, that the Opinions themſelves yield little of powerful Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the embracing of them. But the greateſt thing that is apt to make people of good affections to ſtagger, is the <hi>ſtrict lives</hi> of many that take theſe courſes: But yet if we ſeriouſly conſider this, it doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſo ſtrong a temptation, as at firſt view
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41777:77"/>it ſeems to do. That <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> of whom theſe people talk ſo much, is ſaid to have <hi>a golden Cup in her hand,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 17.4.</note> full of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the filthineſs of her Fornication.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are many of them of as ſtrict lives, as our <hi>Sectaries:</hi> And their <hi>Monks,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> deliver as ſtrict <hi>rules</hi> for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of our Converſation, as any men can; and have as ſublime and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, many times, in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of Scripture: But if I meet with, and approve theſe things in one leaf, and in the next, find <hi>blaſphemous</hi> expreſſions of honour to the bleſſed Virgin, and other Saints, and prayers put up unto them; ſhall I therefore cloſe with their Errors and Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find ſomething amongſt them which I love? Yea, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who are at this day the profeſſed enemies of Chriſt, are for the moſt part as <hi>faithful</hi> in their word, as <hi>juſt</hi> in their dealings, and of as ſtrict and <hi>temperate</hi> lives, as our <hi>Opiniators:</hi> But this ſhall never make me to love Judaiſm, or Mahometaniſm the better. He was not a wiſe child that threw the whole <hi>Apple</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, becauſe ſome of it was rotten; nor yet he that greedily eat up the rotten together with the ſound; but he that pared out the rotten, and fed upon that which was ſound: So they do not well who cry out againſt a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Religion, and <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> of life, becauſe theſe things are to be found among them that are <hi>erronious:</hi> Nor are they ſo
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41777:77"/>wiſe as they ſhould be, who becauſe they ſee many things commendable in the <hi>lives</hi> of thoſe that differ from us, do therefore turn to an embracing of their <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Schiſms.</hi> But this is the truly wiſe and chriſtian courſe, To love that which is good in every man, to love and <hi>imitate</hi> the ſtrictneſs and <hi>circumſpection</hi> of their lives, yea, to let them know that they do not outdo us therein; but yet to <hi>avoid</hi> and abhor their <hi>Errors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed a man were not fit to be an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, if he were of a lewd life. <hi>Nullis aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita bibuntur Fictilibus; tunc illa time,</hi> &amp;c. Satan hath the better advantage in tempting men to drink this <hi>poyſon</hi> of errors, by dazling their eyes with the luſtre of the golden <hi>Cup</hi> in which he preſents it. Let us labour to be ſo wiſe as to examine the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as well as the practiſes of thoſe with whom we cloſe, and not raſhly to joyn with perſons of ſtrange principles, though of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrict lives.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It will greatly concern us all to take heed of ſpiritual <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as that which will greatly hazzard our ſtanding faſt in the Faith. We have ſeen in our time many ſtately Cedars blown up by the roots, thoſe that have been very high and lofty, not only for natural Gifts and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but, at leaſt for a ſhew of a very high meaſure of zeal for God; yet how have they been overturned by thoſe turbulent winds of ſtrange Doctrine. It behoves us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41777:78"/>to take the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> exhortation:
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Be not high minded, but fear.</hi> We ſhould not be puffed up ſo as to ſcorn or <hi>deſpiſe</hi> thoſe that are fallen, but <hi>pitty</hi> them, as knowing that we alſo are <hi>men ſubject to the ſame infirmities,</hi> if God ſhould leave us to our ſelves. We ſhould not entertain high thoughts of our own ſtrength, becauſe we have ſtood faſt thus far, as if we had been ſupported by our own abilities; or as if it were not poſſible for ſuch as we are, to be deceived: For as there is nothing more <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to God then pride, and of all pride ſpiritual pride is the worſt; ſo nothing is more likely to <hi>provoke</hi> God to leave us to our ſelves, then theſe high thoughts of our own ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Beſide, Reaſon and Experience ſhew, that <hi>confidence</hi> doth uſually invite men to <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,</hi> and that prepares men for a <hi>fall:</hi> Had men been well <hi>ballaſted</hi> with Humility, they would not have been ſo far toſſed with this <hi>ſail</hi> of ſelf-conceit, as to deſpiſe the teachings of thoſe that are called to that Office, and to think themſelves wiſer then their teachers, ſo as to prefer their own bare groundleſs <hi>conceits,</hi> before all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Scriptures that can be produced to the contrary, and their own fancical <hi>wreſting</hi> of Scripture, before the plain and <hi>obvious</hi> meaning of it, and the concurrent judgment of the Church of God in all ages concerning it. Were men ſo lowly in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming of themſelves, that they could be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41777:78"/>perſwaded that it is poſſible for them to be in a miſtake, they would not add ſuch <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> to their errors, but would be in a fair way to be convinced: And therefore, as that which will expoſe us to great and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger, let us take heed of confidence and ſelf-conceitedneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It will behove us to take heed of a <hi>looſe and unſetled ſpirit,</hi> in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.12.</note> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts him <hi>that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he ſtandeth, to take heed leſt he fall:</hi> And the firſt thing requiſite, to taking heed leſt we fall, is, to ſee that we ſtand upon firm ground. <hi>Ships</hi> that are floating on the Sea, are toſſed to and fro with every wind and ſtorm, whereas the beating of the Waves againſt a <hi>Rock,</hi> doth not move it, but onely daſheth themſelves to pieces againſt it. How dangerous a courſe do they take, who, though they do not <hi>profeſs</hi> any palpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, yet ſhew a great <hi>indifferency</hi> of ſpirit about points of great concernment, and are not affraid to hear Errors, as well as the Truth, taught; nor do they fear any infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby, but rather live between Truth and Error, as if each of them were equally their <hi>proper Element.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I think every man that is well in his wits, would both account it hazzardous to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health, and alſo a tempting of Divine Providence, to adventure into infectious Houſes, or Companies, under the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an healthy conſtitution, or of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41777:79"/>
                        <hi>truſting</hi> Gods Providence to preſerve him in one place, as well as another. And if the ſoul be the more precious part, they muſt needs be eſteemed to run a greater haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, who will adventure to <hi>dally</hi> with all ſorts of Principles, till at laſt they have brought themſelves to a careleſs <hi>indifferency,</hi> and a Laodicean <hi>luke-warmneſs</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Which frame of ſpirit, as it is very <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing</hi> to God, arguing want of a due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of love to him, and thereby provokes him <hi>to give men over to their own hearts luſts,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.12.</note> to walk in their own counſels:</hi> So it doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe the mind (Reaſon and Experience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judges) to <hi>neglect</hi> that induſtry which it ought to exerciſe in contending for the Truth; yea, to a readineſs to entertain Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as ſoon as Truth; and is indeed the foundation of that <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> in matters of Religion, which makes them utterly to ſeek in the points of our Faith: And this (if Gods mercy interpoſe not) is the high way to lead men to <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. It will greatly concern all ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to ſtand faſt in the Faith, <hi>to avoid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Teachers,</hi> and to keep cloſe to the <hi>publick Ordinances:
<note place="margin">Prov. 19.27.</note> Solomon</hi> exhorts us <hi>to ceaſe from hearing the inſtruction that cauſeth us to err from the words of Knowledg;</hi> and to <hi>watch dayly at Wiſdoms gates.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 8.34.</note> Certainly, many people by going from Gods bleſſing in his publick Ordinances, into that warm

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 91.11.</note> And therefore it will greatly concern every man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to keep in the Wayes and Truth of God, <hi>To ſeek Chriſt in going forth by the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the flock,

                        <hi>I will go and return to my firſt husband, for then it was better with me than now.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Let me ask you (and I pray be ſerious in anſwering); Where did you firſt receive
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41777:82"/>the foundation of that <hi>light,</hi> which you ſo much talk of? How came you firſt to know any thing of God, and of the things that appertain to your Salvation? Was it not by attending upon that Miniſtry, which you now deſpiſe as <hi>Antichriſtian?</hi> You did not bring this knowledge into the world with you: And you could not learn it in private <hi>Meetings,</hi> ſeeing many of the elder ſort of you profeſs your ſelves to have had ſomething of the knowledge of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you frequented theſe Meetings; yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were any ſuch Societies for you to joyn with: And therefore, if you will deal fairly, you muſt acknowledge thoſe ſparks to have been kindled in you, by the preaching of the Word of God as the means. And how can you poſſibly ſo far rub all modeſty out of your Fore-heads, as with ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to pronounce <hi>that Miniſtry Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which was the means first to diſcover the true Chriſt to you?</hi> Or do you think your ſelves to deal ingenuouſly in ſetting ſo ſoul a foot upon that ſtep which firſt raiſed you from the ground; and caſting away that ladder which helped you up, that it may not ſtand to upbraid you with the help it hath given you? Is not this, <hi>wantonneſs</hi> of ſpirit and a ſpiritual <hi>fulneſs,</hi> which keeps you from hungring and thirſting after the Word of God? that makes you loath the Manna of Gods publick Ordinances, and to long for fleſh of your own fancying?
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41777:83"/>Were it not better to acquieſce in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Judgement in this caſe:
<note place="margin">Luk. 5.39.</note> 
                        <hi>No man having drunk old wine, ſtraight-way deſireth new: for he ſaith, The old is better.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let me intreat and <hi>admoniſh</hi> you, <hi>not to condemn the Church of</hi> England <hi>without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
<note place="margin">Joh. 7.51.</note> Doth our Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nicodemus</hi>) <hi>judge any man before it hear him, and knows what he doth?</hi> Certainly, no good Lawes, nor any ſober Chriſtian will judg and condemn any perſon or thing, without hearing and conſidering the matter. Let it pleaſe you therefore, firſt to be ſo much your own friends, as to take the pains to caſt out the leaven of <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> out of your hearts (for theſe, blind the eyes even of the wiſe, that they cannot ſee that which is moſt palpable): And then lay before you the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Creeds</hi> which we own, in the <hi>Catechiſms</hi> of the Church, and in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of our Religion: As alſo the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our Church, which contains our <hi>daily</hi> prayers, and the manner of adminiſtring the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and performing the other <hi>Offices</hi> in the Church. And compare theſe with the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> of other Churches: and ſee where you finde any Church that is more Orthodox and pure in every reſpect: yea, if you finde any thing in it which to a ſober and impartial minde doth ſo much as <hi>appear</hi> to be contrary to the Scriptures.</p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41777:83"/>
                     <p>If you would take this pains, I ſhould verily expect to ſee a great number of thoſe that ſeparate from us; to <hi>flock like Doves to the Windows,</hi> yea, like good Chriſtians, to the <hi>boſome</hi> of Gods Church. If you will not; judge your own ſelves whether your errour be not inexcuſable, in your departing from, and diſowning and oppoſing thoſe things which you do not ſo much as underſtand. <hi>Si accuſâſſe ſat eſt, quis innocens fuerit?</hi> If meerly to cavil, and rail, and calumniate be ſufficient to confute the Doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a Church; without doubt the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been as profoundly confuted as poſſibly can be imagined. It is one of the eaſieſt parts of wit, that conſiſts in finding faults with others, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting what is practiſed by them, as odious and ridiculous. There was never any thing ſo well deviſed by the wiſeſt of men, but he that had a malicious minde and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent tongue, might repreſent as a very ſtrange Monſter, when he had firſt dreſſed it in clothes of his own deviſing: Nor any thing ſo evil and pernicious, but thoſe that loved it, would find ſomething to ſay for it. No marvel then that we have met with ſo many <hi>Pamphlets</hi> ſtuffed with Queries, and Cavils, and Calumnies, to which the beſt Anſwer that can be given, is, <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee</hi> thou evil ſpirit, which art the cauſe of theſe <hi>diviſions of Reuben,</hi> that are the occaſions of ſo many <hi>ſad thoughts

                     <p>But ſetting aſide theſe Cavils which come not from the heart, at leaſt not from a heart ſeriouſly deſirous to be ſatisfied; Will you do your ſelves the right to come to us, who are <hi>Ministers of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note> and Stewards of the Myſteries of God,</hi> as you come to your Lawyer or Phyſitian; move ſuch ſcruples touching the way of our Church, as do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally trouble you; ſhew forth ſuch a ſpirit as doth not come to cavil, but to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſee if (I will not ſay we, but) your own mindes will not ſuggeſt an anſwer to what you can reaſonably object againſt our Church.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Be ſerious and ingenuous in anſwering me one Queſtion more: Do thoſe whom you follow into corners teach you the <hi>ſame</hi> Doctrine which we teach in publick? or do they teach that which is <hi>contrary</hi> to it? If they teach that which is contrary, we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fully to confute them by ſufficient Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Arguments: yea, there is not any one of thoſe many errours which are taught by them that <hi>creep into houſes,</hi> but it hath been fully and ſolidly confuted by the publick Miniſtry; to which nothing can be replyed, but obſtinacy and reſolvedneſs to be deceived.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, they teach the ſame things that we do, Why do you not come to hear them from us? who are likely to teach them
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41777:84"/>more profitably, as being both better quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by <hi>giving our ſelves wholly to theſe things,</hi> and applying our ſelves daily to ſearching of the Holy Scriptures,

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41777:89"/>yield obedience to thoſe <hi>deluſions</hi> that come authorized with this Name. And as in all <hi>Courts</hi> (eſpecially of great Juriſdiction) 'tis a great joy and happineſs to the people, to ſee Order and Juſtice in their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and a great Burden and Miſery, when it is otherwiſe: So it was a great happineſs to man, when this great Court of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was ſetled in due <hi>order,</hi> and is now as great a miſery ſince it is become ſo many wayes <hi>corrupted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look how beautiful and lovely is the face of a well-ordered <hi>State,</hi> where the Prince commands with ſingular <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the Subjects yield Obedience with due <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> ſo amiable a piece was the Soul of man, when the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Conſcience did govern the other faculties with <hi>rectitude</hi> and diſcretion, and the will and affections did moſt <hi>readily</hi> obey, and put in execution theſe rightful Dictates. And if we conſider how ungrateful an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a diſordered State affords to the ages of them that view it, when either <hi>Tyranny,</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> do uſurp the place of <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> or elſe <hi>Faction,</hi> and Rebellion take place of that <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and Dutifulneſs that ſhould be in thoſe that are ſubject: We may from thence conclude how deformed the ſtate of mans <hi>ſoul</hi> is now become, ſince Ignorance and Error have clouded the Underſtanding and Conſcience, where the ſeat of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of right ought to be placed, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41777:89"/>Frowardneſs and Contumacy have raiſed the will and ſenſitive Affections, to a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the commands of Reaſon and Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Whether of theſe two, the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the <hi>Commanding,</hi> or the <hi>diſorder</hi> of the <hi>Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Faculties of mans ſoul, be of <hi>greater</hi> miſchief both to our own ſelves in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and alſo to the Community; I ſhall not now ſtrictly enquire or determine. But certainly, as in the Body <hi>Politick,</hi> when <hi>delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi,</hi> the errors of the Leaders will turn to the prejudice of the Followers; and as in the <hi>Natural</hi> Body, an error in the firſt Concoction, is hardly rectified in the ſecond: So in the <hi>Soul,</hi> an error in theſe leading Faculties hath a very pernicious Influence upon the Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to the depraving and debauching of them. When mens <hi>Conſciences</hi> are <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided,</hi> they will eaſily be induced both to an eager <hi>loving</hi> and deſiring, and to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous <hi>proſecuting</hi> of that which is <hi>evil,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their own miſtakes and deluſions do repreſent it as <hi>good;</hi> and thereby offer great violence to a good Conſcience, while they pretend to obey the Dictates of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>It may therefore be of very good uſe, to <hi>obviate</hi> this Diſtemper of mens minds, which is both <hi>Dangerous</hi> and <hi>Epidemical,</hi> by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the <hi>cauſes</hi> of this diſeaſe, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo of the <hi>Diagnoſticks,</hi> which will
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41777:90"/>be a good ſtep toward the learning of its <hi>cure.</hi> And a Diſcourſe of this Nature and Tendency, as it is to theſe times, <hi>a word in due ſeaſon;</hi> ſo it will be very properly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the words I have read unto you, which ſhew us the confeſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning his former condition, that he had been ſo far miſguided in his Conſcience, that he <hi>verily thought with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ought</hi> (or was bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) <hi>to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words are part of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> his Apologetical ſpeech, before <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Festus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> This Appearance is reckoned by thoſe that are skilful in <hi>Chronology,</hi> to have been in the 57th year of our Saviour, and in the ſecond year of <hi>Nero</hi>'s reign, before the time that his rage againſt the Chriſtians carried him forward ſo far as to waſh his hands in their blood. <hi>Claudius,</hi> indeed had ſet out a Decree to baniſh all <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> of which we read, <hi>Act</hi> 18.2 and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Aquila,</hi> &amp; <hi>Priſcilla</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Jews,</hi> among the reſt were forced to come out of <hi>Italy.</hi> But this Edict did not concern them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but becauſe of their being of the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the late Reverend and Learned, D. <hi>Hammond,</hi> tells us, that in the reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> was baniſhed into the Iſle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> and quotes <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for the proof of it. But <hi>Nero</hi> was the firſt of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41777:90"/>all the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, that began to perſecute the Chriſtians, as ſuch; as the aforenamed Authour proves from the words of <hi>Tertullian, Primum Neronem in hane Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>am gladio ferociiſſe: Nero</hi> was the firſt that put men to death, for the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. This perſecution by <hi>Nero,</hi> was not begun when the Apoſtle made this Speech; and therefore in defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he doth not ſhrink from the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, for fear of ſhame or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo he pleads <hi>Not guilty,</hi> as to the breach of any Law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by any thing he had ſpoken or done; and therefore claims the priviledge of a Roman-<hi>Citizen,</hi> notwithſtanding his being a Chriſtian, and hopes to be delivered by appealing to <hi>Caeſar, chap.</hi> 25.11.</p>
                  <p>This I thought neceſſary to put you in mind of, that you might the more eaſily apprehend the <hi>purport</hi> of the Apoſtle's ſpeech,

                  <p>Now for the ſubſtance and ſcope of this Speech, I ſhall ſet it before you in a few Words. After the <hi>Preface,</hi> verſ. 2.3. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he in ſinuates into the affections of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> before whom he was to plead his Cauſe: he ſets forth the <hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>former life,</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41777:91"/>Sect amongſt the Jews: and that now he did not differ from his former Principles, any further than that he <hi>did believe thoſe Promiſes to be already accompliſhed,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7.</note> which all the twelve Tribes did hope for,</hi> onely they were not yet convinced, that they had took effect in that Jeſus whom they had put to death. Then he endeavours to perſwade his hearers,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.</note> both of the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of God having raiſed up Chriſt from <hi>the dead;</hi> and alſo of the preſent unbelieving Jews being miſtaken in that <hi>Zeal,</hi> or rather <hi>Fury,</hi> which they ſhewed in oppoſing Chriſt, and perſecuting thoſe that did profeſs his Name. And, that they might not be too confident of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the right, he tells them that for his own part he had been formerly of the ſame minde with them, and had ſpent much pains in oppoſing and perſecuting thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> until ſuch time as it pleaſed God to work in him a ſaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the errour of the way he had been in; which he goes on in relating, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes.</p>
                  <p>So that the words of the Text, conſidered with reference to what <hi>goes before,</hi> are an Argument intended for the <hi>perſwading</hi> of the King and the reſt of the Auditory, that it was poſſible for the Jews to be miſtaken in their zeal againſt Chriſt, ſeeing himſelf had been made ſenſible of his miſtake in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their principles, and being zealous for them.

                  <p>Inſtead of a more exact or artificial <hi>diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Text, I ſhall reſolve it into two <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,</hi> which the Apoſtle points at herein, and of which he endeavours to convince his hearers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Pofition, <hi>That a mans Conſcience may be ſo far deluded, as that he may verily think himſelf bound in Conſcience to do that which is amiſs.</hi>

                  <p>The conſequence of theſe, from the ſcope and deſign of the Apoſtle's confeſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, is ſo clear to every man, that ſeriouſly obſerves his meaning, that I ſhall not trouble you with ſpending time in making it out, but preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to the opening of the <hi>Poſitions</hi> in order.</p>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:41777:92"/>
                  <p>In this Deſcription there are <hi>five terms</hi> worthy our conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Genus</hi> of Conſcience, is, a <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty.</hi> That Conſcience cannot ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſtiled, either an <hi>Act</hi> or an <hi>Habit,</hi> I think is plain enough; and therefore it is moſt properly termed a <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty,</hi> wherewith God hath endowed the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man. But in the Scriptures, as Faith and Love are ſometimes uſed to ſignifie the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> of thoſe Graces, and ſometimes the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of them: So <hi>Conſcience</hi> is ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for the actings or <hi>dictates</hi> of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as when the Apoſtle tells the people, That he <hi>had lived in all good Conſcience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 23.1.</note> that is, according to the dictates of Conſcience: ſometimes for the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty</hi> from whence theſe actings proceed, as when he ſaith, He had <hi>exerciſed himſelf herein,
<note place="margin">Acts 24.16.</note> to have alwayes a Conſcience void of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Seat</hi> of Conſcience, is ſaid to be in the <hi>practical</hi> part of our Underſtanding. It is peculiar to <hi>underſtanding</hi> Creatures, to have a Conſcience; and the more clear any mans Underſtanding is, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the more refined are the motions of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in him. And, that Conſcience is ſeated ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Underſtanding then in the <hi>Will,</hi> is evident, in that Conſcience will many times do its office, though the Will do hang back never ſo much. And further, we ſay 'tis ſeated in the <hi>practical</hi> Underſtanding,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41777:93"/>becauſe as the office of the <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, is, to judge of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> ſo the <hi>practical</hi> judgeth of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Office</hi> of Conſcience, is, to <hi>judge.</hi> The judgement that Conſcience paſſeth, may be conceived to be in ſuch a way as this. What the Scripture approves, is good and to be followed: But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth approve this: Therefore it is good and to be followed. What the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture condemns, is evil and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided: But the Scripture condemns ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> and ſuch courſes: Therefore they are evil and to be avoided. Some Divines ſay, that in the <hi>major</hi> propoſition, Conſcience is <hi>Lex:</hi> Though I think that expreſſion not to be very proper, becauſe Conſcience doth not lay down this Law by its own Authority, but takes it from the Word of God, yet ſo as to aſſent to the Authority of it: and in this reſpect Conſcience is ſometimes called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, becauſe it keepeth the Law of God in our mindes. In the <hi>Minor</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Conſcience is called <hi>Teſtis.</hi> In the <hi>Concluſion, Judex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Object</hi> of this Judgement, is, both <hi>our ſelves</hi> and our <hi>actions.</hi> Concerning <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or our own Condition towards God, Conſcience paſſeth judgement in this ſort: The Scripture ſaith, He that truely repenteth of his ſins, and reſteth by Faith upon the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt is in the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41777:93"/>way to Eternal life; but he that goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes obſtinately and ſecurely, is in the broad way that leads to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of death. Now accordingly as Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence findes our Condition to be, either peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or impenitent, ſo it pronounceth us to be either in a good or bad way. Concerning our <hi>actions</hi> Conſcience paſſeth Sentence, partly <hi>before</hi> we enter upon them; and as it findes them either agreeing with, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of God, ſo it either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth us to them, or diſſwades us from them: partly <hi>afterward,</hi> and then by the ſame rule of the agreeing of our actions to the Will of God, or oppoſing of it, ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth either accuſe or excuſe and commend us for what we have done.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Rule</hi> by which Conſcience ought to proceed in judging of our Perſons and Actions, is, the <hi>Law of God.</hi> This Law is either that which was <hi>written</hi> upon mans <hi>heart,</hi> which though ſadly defaced by the Fall, yet ſome remainders of it are to be found in all men, and according to this the Heathen that know no other Law,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15.</note> are to judge of their actions: or elſe that which is written in the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this all of us ſhould judge our ſelves and our actions. It will not be ſufficient that our Conſciences ſpeak peace to us, and tell us that our actions are good, and our ſelves in a good eſtate, except this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conſcience be grounded upon the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41777:94"/>Word of God. For if we hold Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be the <hi>ſupream Judge,</hi> and that we are to attend wholly to it, without looking to any other Rule, hence will follow a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>abſurdity.</hi> 1. Hence it will follow, that Conſcience is <hi>infallible:</hi> and ſo thoſe that beſtow ſo much Zeal in crying out againſt one <hi>Antichrist,</hi> will ſet up many <hi>Infallibles</hi> in his ſtead, even as many as be of this <hi>Opinion.</hi> But, that Conſcience is not infallible, may be evident by this, that one mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth (at leaſt in pretence) dictate that which is quite contrary to the dictates of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans Conſcience; and therefore one of them muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be in a <hi>miſtake,</hi> and conſequently not infallible. 2. It will alſo follow, that a man would alwaies do <hi>right,</hi> when he acts according to the <hi>dictates</hi> of Conſcience. But, that this is not true, is ſufficiently evident by the example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> here before us, who before his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did verily think himſelf bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to do what he did againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but this did not bear him out in it, as you will ſee more fully anon.</p>
                  <p>You ſee then the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of Conſcience, which will open our way for ſetting before you the dangerous <hi>miſtakes</hi> of Conſcience. The office of Conſcience, you have heard, is, to take <hi>cognizance</hi> of, and paſs a <hi>judgement</hi> upon our actions, according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of Gods Law, ſo as to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or diſcourage us before we enter upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41777:94"/>them; and to accuſe or excuſe us, after we have done them. And herein chiefly lies the <hi>miſchievous</hi> miſtake of Conſcience, that either it ſelf doth erre by <hi>miſtaking</hi> its Rule, and thereby comes to paſs a wrong <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon our actions: or elſe (which may as probably be imagined) ſomething elſe <hi>intrudes</hi> into the Office of Conſcience on purpoſe to deceive us, by encouraging us to that which is evil, and diſſwading us from that which is good; accuſing us when we have done that which is good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and excuſing us when we have done that which is evil and unwarrantable. And by this means men are not onely <hi>drawn</hi> to evil courſes, but <hi>encouraged</hi> and <hi>hardned</hi> in them, whilſt they conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to follow the motions of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though all the while they are doing that which is quite contrary to a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Now there are eſpecially <hi>three things</hi> that are ready to ſtep into the ſeat of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to delude us into a belief that we are led by Conſcience, when we are ſtirred up by a worſe principle, and do thoſe things which are contrary to the right dictates of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes <hi>the ſtrength of Fancy or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination</hi> uſurps the office of Conſcience, and makes men believe they are prompted by Conſcience to do ſuch and ſuch things, when it is nothing but <hi>Fancy</hi> that hurries
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41777:95"/>them forward. It is ſtrange to obſerve how powerful Imagination is, not onely to <hi>carry</hi> men violently forward in their motions; but alſo to <hi>diſguiſe</hi> it ſelf ſo ſubtilly, that men will ſtrongly <hi>conceit</hi> themſelves not to be <hi>conceited</hi> in what they do. If we look to the <hi>Sanguin</hi>-Fancies that proceed from ſuch a Conſtitution of the Body, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remarkable ſtories have we both of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and of many <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who under the lowd <hi>cry</hi> of Conſcience, and Liberty of Conſcience, have onely <hi>hunted</hi> for game to ſatisfie the foul luſt of Uncleanneſs? Yea, and made the filly people of the world (if not themſelves among the reſt) to believe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> it ſelf ſhould not be <hi>filthy,</hi> nor unlawful, while it did gratifie perſons ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>favour</hi> of God, as they were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to pronounce themſelves to be. It is not indeed ſo <hi>ſtrange,</hi> as it is <hi>ſad,</hi> that ſuch perſons have prevailed ſo far, as to impoſe upon many of the injudicious Vulgar with theſe pretences: but that they could ſo far delude themſelves as to conceit that they were acted by Conſcience and by the Spirit of God, in theſe courſes, ſeems a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Wonder. The chiefeſt Reaſon I can give of the prevalency of this deluſion, is, that theſe Fancies move them with ſo much <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>impetuouſneſs,</hi> being help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward by <hi>Satan</hi> who watcheth all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to enſnare the ſoul, that the poor
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41777:95"/>deluded ſoul is ready to conceit it ſelf to be moved by ſome extraordinary <hi>impulſe</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, and ſo gives it ſelf up confidently to the luſtful embracing of a <hi>Cloud,</hi> in the ſhape of <hi>Juno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for that other humour of <hi>Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 'tis ſtrange to obſerve the effects of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fancy; this uſeth to beget <hi>ſowre</hi> and <hi>ſad</hi> fancies. And the ſtories which Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Hiſtorians relate concerning the effects hereof, are ſo ſtrange, that they would ſeem incredible to vulgar ears. And doubtleſs in many 'tis a ſowre and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick</hi> temper of body (and <hi>pride</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that is the cauſe of their <hi>ſevere</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to diſlike and find fault with what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is practiſed by others; and to effect a ſtrange and <hi>uncouth</hi> way of living, under the notion of <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Denying</hi> of themſelves. And in good people alſo, the prevalency of this Temper, is many times conſpicuous: To this, many of their groundleſs <hi>Doubts</hi> and fears, as to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eſtate, do owe their beginning: which though they repreſent themſelves as the fruits of <hi>tenderneſs</hi> of Conſcience, and are ſeldom or never to be found, but in perſons of truly tender Conſciences (as many bad weeds do not grow, but in the beſt ſoyl;) yet they are evil in themſelves, as being a <hi>falſe</hi> judgement paſſed upon our ſelves, and a <hi>denying</hi> the great things which God hath done for our ſouls; and as to their <hi>tendency,</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41777:96"/>which is ordinarily the hindering of the ſoul from its <hi>vigorous</hi> actings in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and from taking due <hi>comfort</hi> in the performances which Gods Spirit hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it through: Theſe I ſay, are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the conſtitution of the body, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by Satans Temptations.</p>
                  <p>If any enquire, upon hearing this, How we may <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> theſe workings of <hi>Fancy</hi> from the true and genuin Motions of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</hi> and truly know what <hi>impulſes</hi> we are to follow, and what to reject? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Look to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of thy Body; or if thou haſt not much skill in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, be content to receive the <hi>advice</hi> of thoſe that are able and competent Judges of it. Art thou of a <hi>ſanguin</hi> Conſtitution, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the motions that ſolicite thee to a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, to be of that nature? Or art thou naturally inclined to <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and findeſt ſuch motions in thee as are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that humour? It will be a great right done to Conſcience, to forbear to impute thoſe motions to it, which our own Reaſon may ſhew us to come from another cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve when the temper of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth <hi>alter,</hi> and ſee whether theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inclinations do alter with it. It is ſufficiently evident, that the temper of mens bodies doth admit of alteration. The Sanguin temper will alter by <hi>age</hi> or <hi>ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:41777:96"/>or worldly cares: The Melancholick will vary by change of <hi>Air,</hi> or <hi>Dyet,</hi> or by the uſe of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> beſide thoſe <hi>lucid</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals wherein moſt Melancholick perſons do meet with an <hi>abatement</hi> of that humour. Now ask thy own experience, whether theſe motions do not ebb and flow, according to the abating and encreaſing of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers in thy body? If ſo, there is great reaſon to impute theſe motions and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not to Conſcience, but to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thy body; and it would be a great wrong to the ſacred name of Conſcience, to father them upon it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Even the motions of <hi>Luſt</hi> will ſometimes deceive us, under the pretence of being the dictates of Conſcience. This may ſeem very <hi>ſtrange</hi> to them that have never been willing to put themſelves to the trouble of examining the motions, which they have followed, whence they have come: But it is very palpable to every man, that with a diſcerning eye, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed mind, looks upon them. Sometimes the luſt of the <hi>Eye, Covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> lapps it ſelf in the Mantle of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Come ſee my zeal,
<note place="margin">2 King. 10.16.</note> for the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jehu;</hi> when every man knows that it was ſomewhat elſe, and not true zeal, that made him <hi>drive ſo furiouſly.</hi> Yea, ſome may go ſo far as not only to deceive others, but themſelves alſo, in this point; as, in their denying <hi>Tythes,</hi> and other <hi>Payments,</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:41777:97"/>'tis too too palpable, that Covetouſneſs hath taken the place and office of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and yet ſets ſo bold a face upon it, as if it were pure Conſcience that guided theſe men to ſuch practiſes. Sometimes that luſt of <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> may put us forward to ſerve it under the notion of Conſcience: So the Scribes and Phariſees perſecuted Chriſt out of malice, and yet with a great ſhew of Zeal and Conſcience: And thoſe others, of whom our Saviour fore-tels, that they would perſecute his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.2.</note> and <hi>verily think they did God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> in doing it. Now if any enquire of the manner how theſe luſts come to prevail ſo far as to deceive us under the name of Conſcience, I need ſay no more then I did upon the former Head, <hi>viz</hi> That the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs</hi> of theſe motions in the mind, may be apt to make us miſtake them for ſome extraordinary <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> which we ought not to reſiſt. But to undeceive us in this point, it may be very uſeful to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That what motions ſoever do encline us to any thing that is <hi>forbidden</hi> by the Law of God, are evil and to be <hi>rejected:</hi> Now the motions of luſt, do alwayes ſtir us up to do that which is contrary to Gods Law, and therefore are to be <hi>oppoſed,</hi> though never ſo ſuitable and grateful to our ſenſitive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.20.</note> 
                     <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> we ought to look, and whatſoever perſons or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41777:97"/>motions are contrary to that, this very thing is ſufficient to convince us, that they are not of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we find our ſelves to be zealouſly carried forward, onely in <hi>ſome things</hi> that tend to our own profit, or pleaſure, and careleſs and remiſs in <hi>other things,</hi> we have great reaſon to conclude theſe zealous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not to proceed from Conſcience, but a worſe Principle.
<note place="margin">2 Kings 10.28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Jehu deſtroyed Baal out of Iſrael,</hi> and was very zealous in it, as that which was a fair pretence for cutting off the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that none might be left to lay claim to the Crown; and alſo to dazle the eyes of the people, that they might not riſe up in oppoſition to him, who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſo zealous in executing the Lords pleaſure: <hi>But from the ſins of Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am the ſon of Nebat,</hi> the ſerving of the <hi>gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Calves at Dan and Bethel, from theſe he departed not,</hi> becauſe he thought the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this, to be a good piece of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to keep the people from returning to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, leſt they ſhould alſo carry back the Kingdom to the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi> Hereby <hi>Jehu</hi> did diſcover, that it was not zeal for God, but Covetouſneſs and Ambition, that made him ſo ſtrict in obeying Gods commands in other reſpects: And if any man find the ſame temper and tendency in his zeal, he will have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect the ſame things concerning it.</p>

                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:41777:98"/>3. Satans <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> may ſometimes impoſe upon men, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſcience, and <hi>inſpirations</hi> from the Spirit of God. The Apoſtle tells us, that Satan hath an art to <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of light;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> to repreſent his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, as the advice of ſome good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or as the motions of the holy Spirit of God. He had the impudence to cite the Scripture in his tempting of our Saviour;
<note place="margin">Mat. 4.6.</note> and therefore it is no marvel, if he ſeduce ſo many ignorant people to pervert the Scriptures, for the encouraging of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do that which is quite contrary to the meaning of the Scriptures. Yea, we have very ſtrong reaſons to perſwade us, that thoſe <hi>raptures</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſms,</hi> which have poſſeſſed ſome of them, have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but an higher degree of the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Satan</hi> in them. And that they may not think we uſe them hardly in ſpending ſuch a cenſure upon them, let them but conſider how many of them, under the <hi>pretence</hi> of theſe <hi>Inſtincts,</hi> have encouraged themſelves in <hi>Murthers, Adulteries,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greateſt ſorts of Impieties, which are no way imputable to the motions of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who as he is a moſt <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Spirit, ſo is he far from inclining any man to that which is <hi>impure</hi> or <hi>unjuſt,</hi> but doth abhor ſuch practiſes himſelf, and ſtirs up all thoſe that are acted by him, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loathing and abhorring of them.</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:41777:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Now for <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> the temptations of the evil ſpirit from thoſe motions that come from the good Spirit of God, I ſhall, to what was ſpoken upon the former head, add onely one Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That it will greatly concern us to obſerve the <hi>tendency</hi> of theſe Motions: The Spirit of God, as it doth not move us to any thing that is evil in it ſelf, ſo neither to any thing that tends directly to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of evil. And therefore, If any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſeem never ſo ſpecious, that look like Angels of Light at their firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, do yet tend to draw us to evil in the <hi>iſſue;</hi> if they tend either to draw us to any groſs <hi>impiety</hi> or <hi>diſhoneſty,</hi> if they deſigne to draw us to the venting and maintaining any dangerous or <hi>ſtrange Doctrine,</hi> or to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>rents</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> in the Church; we have reaſon to reject theſe, as <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> of Satan, however they may make a ſhew of advancing us to higher attainments then ordinary. And thus we have ſeen, how the Conſcience may be impoſed upon ſo far, that men may think verily, that they ought, or are bound in Duty and Conſcience, to do that which is really amiſs.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to the other Poſition,
<note n="2" place="margin">Poſition.</note> 
                     <hi>That this miſtake or miſguiding of Conſcience, doth not excuſe or warrant thoſe irregularities, which men erroniouſly run into.</hi> It is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for men to plead Conſcience for what they do, that their Conſcience binds them to do this, and to abhor the other;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41777:99"/>except they can ſhew ſufficient grounds for theſe motions and inclinations that are imputed to Conſcience, this will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them in what they do. This, I think, is ſo clear, that it cannot but be received by every ſerious and ſober perſon, ſo that I ſhall not need to ſpend many words for the confirmation of it: onely let me entreat you to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is a notable inſtance to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. While a perſon is diſtempered in minde, he is not capable of judging how ſad a condition he is in; but when he is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of it, then is he very ſenſible of the ſad condition he was formerly in, and of the great cure that hath been wrought in his recovery. So men that are under theſe deluſions of Conſcience, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges of their own actions; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> who recovered out of this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may more properly be heard to ſpeak in this caſe. He tells us in the Text, that he did not perſecute Chriſt out of <hi>malice</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his perſon; but becauſe, through the <hi>miſguiding</hi> of his Conſcience, he did not believe him to be the true <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> But doth he think this ſufficient to <hi>warrant,</hi> or yet <hi>excuſe</hi> his perſecution? No, for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, he calls his ſins by their proper names, and acknowledgeth himſelf to have been <hi>a blaſphemer,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13, 15, 16</note> and a perſecutor, and injurious;</hi> yea, the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41777:99"/>ſuch an one that it was a great wonder that ever <hi>the Lord had ſhewed him mercy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.6.</note> He tells us that <hi>he had perſecuted the Church with Zeal</hi> as hot as fire. But doth he think that the heat of his Zeal would awarrant the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity of his actions? No, but tells us that he was <hi>the least of the Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.9.</note> and not worthy the name of an Apostle, becauſe he had perſecuted the Church of God.</hi> And what we have ſaid of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate eſtate, we may ſay of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Jews of that age, that <hi>they had a Zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.2.</note> And what they did unto our Saviour <hi>(the common people denied the Holy One and the Juſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 3.14, 15, 16.</note> and their <hi>Rulers killed the Prince of Life</hi>) St. <hi>Peter</hi> bears them witneſs that they did it <hi>through ignorance,</hi> both <hi>the People and Rulers.</hi> But ſhall we think that this did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe ſo horrid a fault? No, the Apoſtle tells them that for that very ſin,

                     <hi>The wrath of God was come upon them to the utmoſt,</hi> and ſo hath continued for ſo many hundreds of years.

And, as the opinion of a <hi>Judge,</hi> who is bound to adhere to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, doth not make that to be Law which is contrary to the written Laws; it being very unreaſonable to think that his tranſgreſſing the bounds of his Office, ſhould excuſe another, that adventures to do that which is forbidden: So Conſcience, which is bound to proceed in judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of God, if it neglect this <hi>Rule,</hi> cannot awarrant a man in doing that which is contrary to this Rule. And it would be very unreaſonable for any man to imagine that theſe miſtaken dictates of Conſcience ſhould excuſe him that follows them, except Conſcience were the <hi>Supream Law;</hi> the contrary whereof I have ſhewed before.</p>

And thoſe therefore that make it the <hi>firſt principle,</hi> which they teach their Diſciples, to <hi>forſake</hi> and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the publick Ordinances, for fear leſt they ſhould be convinced of the errors which they are running into,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 11.2.</note> do make ſuch a Covenant with them, as <hi>Nahaſh</hi> deſired to do with the Children of <hi>Iſrael, To thruſt out their right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon Iſrael:</hi> And they ſhew that they have rather ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a ſtrong fancy to their own Conceits, then that they have a well-informed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a ſincere deſire to do as they ought.</p>
                  <p>By theſe and ſuch like <hi>Rules,</hi> we may both <hi>try</hi> thoſe motions that we find in our own minds, whether they proceed from a well-informed Conſcience or no: And alſo may give a <hi>gheſs</hi> at thoſe who are about us, whether they be in good earneſt, and well-adviſed in their large talking of Conſcience in their proceedings. And that I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you to lay theſe things to heart, let me add, that 'Tis a buſineſs of great <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,</hi> to have our judgments well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41777:103"/>in this point: and that I ſhall briefly demonſtrate, by ſhewing in <hi>two words,</hi> the great <hi>hazzard</hi> that men run in entertaining their own fancies, or the motions of luſt, or the ſuggeſtions of Satan, for motions of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, While men embrace theſe deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſin at a more <hi>dangerous rate</hi> then other men; in that they go on the more <hi>earneſtly</hi> and <hi>confidently</hi> in evil, while they think they do <hi>God good ſervice</hi> in doing it: And further, they are harder to be <hi>reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> then a prophane perſon, <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own conceit,
<note place="margin">Porv. 26.12.</note> there is more hope of a fool, then of him.</hi> Beſides that they <hi>aggravate</hi> their ſins, by taking the ſacred name of Conſcience <hi>in vain,</hi> while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to Patronize them in that which is evil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When ſuch men come in <hi>cool blood</hi> to conſider what they have done, and to find out the miſtakes they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the thoughts of being acted by Conſcience, it may be in danger to make them <hi>caſt off</hi> all Conſcience, and turn <hi>Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in matters of Religion, which are next door to <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> Add to this, that the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant</hi> courſes which many have taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of being led by their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hath ſadly opened the mouths of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons, to <hi>ſcorn</hi> at Conſcience it ſelf, and take no care to keep a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or to do that which is agreeable to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:41777:103"/>2. It may be very wholſome and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advice,
<note n="2" place="margin">Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> to endeavour rightly to inform our ſelves in the nature of the true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty:</hi> which will be one ſpecial help to the due information of our Conſciences, in many controverted points. It is moſt certain, that, beſide the Liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath, and from the thraldome, and ſlavery of ſin and Satan; there is likewiſe this further Liberty which every Chriſtian may comfortably expect under this New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that was not to be enjoyed under the old, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the <hi>ſincere purpoſe and deſire</hi> of our ſoul be to pleaſe God, and this deſire do ſhew it ſelf to be real, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and <hi>diligent endeavouring</hi> to walk in thoſe wayes which are acceptable to God; our gracious and merciful Father will not be extream to mark thoſe <hi>defects</hi> that proceed from the <hi>infirmity of our Nature,</hi> but will cover our imperfections, and accept of our Obedience, through the perfection of Chriſts obedience. And further, that in <hi>things,</hi> which in their own Nature are truly <hi>indifferent,</hi> there is much Liberty allowed us by God, provided ſtill that our deſires be towards his Glory in what we do.</p>
                  <p>Now as the due apprehenſion of this would be of great advantage to us, to make us go on the more cheerfully and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in his ſervice; ſo for want of being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed about it, the ſoul doth ſuſtain
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41777:104"/>much prejudice. Some, by <hi>overſtretching</hi> the Nature of Chriſtian Liberty, have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs;</hi> and others, by not underſtanding how far this Liberty doth extend, have incurred great <hi>prejudice.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence have proceeded <hi>endleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſcruples</hi> in the Conſcience. The word <hi>ſcruple</hi> (as ſome ſay) comes from that <hi>duſt or gravel in our ſhooes,</hi> which, though ſmall in it ſelf, yet gives us great trouble being in ſuch a place. And ſo, Scruples in the Conſcience, though ſmall and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in themſelves, yet do greatly diſturb the mind. Indeed, when men pretend to ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in ſmall and indifferent matters, while they can take too much Liberty in matters that go nearer to the life of Religion; 'tis a ſigne that their Conſciences are ſick of a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> diſeaſe. But yet 'tis ſufficiently evident, that the <hi>ſobereſt</hi> and truly <hi>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> people are much diſturbed in their minds with ſuch ſcruples, as even themſelves are ſenſible that there is little weight in them. And though this trouble doth argue a ſincere deſire in the ſoul to pleaſe God, yet 'tis of bad conſequence, as tending to diſturb and <hi>diſtract</hi> the ſoul in good duties, and to take off that <hi>cheerfulneſs</hi> which ought to be in us, in ſerving ſo good a Maſter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence a man may come to a <hi>doubting Conſcience.</hi> Divines diſtinguiſh thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſcrupulous, and a doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41777:104"/>A <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> Conſcience, is, when a man is ſatisfied in the main, of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of an action, but yet there are ſome odde inconſiderable thoughts in his mind which trouble it: A <hi>doubting</hi> Conſcience, is, when a man doubts in the main of the lawfulneſs of the action. And accordingly they reſolve that againſt a ſcrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience a man <hi>may,</hi> yea ſometimes <hi>muſt</hi> of neceſſity proceed, but not againſt a doubting Conſcience: Now through ignorance of the due extent of this Chriſtian Liberty, a man may come to theſe doubtings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which will quite put him to a ſtand in many things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From this a man may come to that which Divines call, <hi>a perplexed Conſcience,</hi> which involves a man in a kind of neceſſity of ſinning. That there is ſuch a perplexed eſtate of Conſcience, may be evident by ſuch an Inſtance as this. Put the caſe that a lawful Authority enjoyn us ſomething about a matter which in its ſelf is <hi>truly indifferent:</hi> If a man doth not yield obedience to it, he ſins againſt the <hi>fifth Commandment,</hi> and if he doth yield obedience, and yet doubts that the thing he doth is unlawful, though he doth not <hi>formally</hi> break any of Gods Commandments, yet <hi>virtually</hi> he doth, in yielding to that which he <hi>believes</hi> to be <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and ſo falls under that cenſure of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. It is indeed a <hi>ſad</hi> caſe when the ſoul is involved in ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41777:105"/>But God is not the Authour of this occaſion of ſin, for he made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>upright,</hi> and 'tis the <hi>fall</hi> of man that hath brought upon it this and all other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. And foraſmuch as you have heard that the miſtake of Conſcience, doth not excuſe the irregularity of an action, it will therefore concern us the more diligently to ſtudy the true Chriſtian Liberty, that we may not at any time come to this paſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <note n="3" place="margin">Infer. ence.</note> Let me add a word of <hi>Caution.</hi> Let no man from what hath been ſpoken, take occaſion to <hi>make light</hi> of Conſcience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have heard that Conſcience may be, and is many times <hi>deceived,</hi> let no man hence conclude that all pretences to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are either <hi>counterfeit</hi> or <hi>erroneous:</hi> That all men who pretend to Conſcience, are either Deceivers, or deceived.</p>
                  <p>Conſcience is a <hi>Sacred</hi> thing, and of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority</hi> with all good men. And thoſe wicked men that will not hearken to the <hi>voice</hi> of Conſcience in this world, but caſt away its cords from them, ſhall in the world to come, find it turned to a <hi>Worm</hi> that ſhall gnaw, and torment their ſouls to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<note n="4" place="margin">Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> To you <hi>Fathers and Brethren of the Clergy,</hi> my ſpeech directs it ſelf. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is evident, that the miſguiding of mens Conſciences is ſo common and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a diſeaſe, and there are ſo many Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers abroad, that lie in wait to deceive
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41777:105"/>them into this inconvenience: Let me therefore take the liberty to put you in mind, whoſe Office obligeth you to be <hi>Guides</hi> to mens Lives and Conſciences; that you uſe all poſſible diligence in the <hi>rectifying</hi> thoſe miſtakes which impoſe upon mens Conſciences; and <hi>cut off</hi> all juſt <hi>occaſion</hi> from them that are ready to <hi>ſeek occaſion</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering up their minds to be ſeduced to an embracing of that which is evil. Let us put no advantage into the hands of falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that make it their buſineſs to deceive ignorant and well-meaning people: Nor let us juſtly provoke ſuch people to deliver up themſelves as a prey to thoſe Foxes and Wolves.

                  <p>It is agreed that this St. <hi>Mark the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi> was the firſt <hi>Biſhop of Alexandria,</hi> as <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> tells us: and that he preached the Goſpel to all thoſe parts, from <hi>Egypt</hi> even to <hi>Pentepolis.</hi> The time of whoſe Preaching the Goſpel in <hi>Egypt,

                        </note> Bucholtzer</hi> determines to be about the 44th. year of Chriſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time when he wrote this Goſpel, no certainty can be gathered out of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<note place="margin">Euſeb.

So that the moſt Learned and diligent ſearchers of Antiquity,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41777:109"/>are not free from over-ſights eſpecially in Chronology. But this by the way.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>occaſion</hi> of the writing of this Goſpel, <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates it thus,
<note place="margin">Eccl.

                  <p>I begin with the leading part of the Text,
<note n="1" place="margin">Part.</note> the <hi>Conjunction</hi> which connects theſe words with what went before. <hi>Pulchre in Metaphorâ a viro perfecto ſumptâ perſeverat,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Meſander</hi> upon this Text. The Apoſtle had been mentioning it but now, as one of the ſpecial benefits which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41777:111"/>by thoſe Officers which Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Church, that we might be built up from the condition of Children, to that of grown men, or men of ſtature in the Faith. And here he proceeds further in ſetting forth this benefit, that being come to the ſtature of men in the knowledge of Chriſt, we ſhould now put away <hi>childiſh</hi> things; <hi>wavering</hi> and <hi>irreſolution</hi> of minde in matters of Faith; and ſet our ſelves as men to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in the Profeſſion of that Faith, into which we have been Baptized. Our Learned <hi>Doctor Hammond</hi> doth expreſs the ſenſe of this illative particle to the life thus: <hi>Which may ſecure us that we henceforth,</hi> &amp;c. So that this Conjunction doth readily offer us this Note. That <hi>the continuance of a powerful and painful Miniſtry in the Church, is one ſpecial expedient to eſtabliſh people in the Faith, and to ſettle them againſt the ſeducements of falſe Teachers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of this is ſo evident to every mans Obſervation, that I ſhall need to ſay very little for the clearing of it. To the Office of a Miniſter it belongs, to ſhew the people the ways of <hi>Truth</hi> which they ought to follow, and by ſo doing, they muſt needs at once ſhew them the by-ways of <hi>errour</hi> which they ought to avoid. For, <hi>Rectum eſt index ſui &amp; obliqui.</hi> To the Office of a Miniſter it appertains to <hi>exhort</hi> and <hi>admoniſh</hi> the people that they <hi>be not drawn away by the errour of the wicked,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> to depart from their
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41777:112"/>own ſtedfaſtneſs, but rather to grow in Grace.</hi> Now <hi>the words of the wiſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, are as nails</hi> to faſten men, <hi>and as goads</hi> to ſtir them forward in that which is good, when they are <hi>faſtned by the wiſe Maſters of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.11.</note> And therefore the labours of ſuch may probably be expected to be effectual, through Gods bleſſing, to <hi>ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, and ſettle</hi> mens mindes againſt the tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Winds of erronious Doctrines. From hence then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may ſee that it is no wonder, that they whoſe deſign it is to <hi>ſeduce</hi> the people to errours, do bear ſuch a bitter and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <hi>hatred</hi> to the <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> that they have ſpent their mouths ſo liberally, in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them and their Function, all the <hi>Calumnies</hi> and ſcurrilities, which the malice of Hell could invent: that the ſubtileſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits amongſt them by attempting to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their ancient and ſettled <hi>maintenance,</hi> have deſigned to ſtop their mouths by ſtarving them, except they would learn, <hi>cum pſittaco ſuum</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The <hi>Wolves</hi> in the Fable, when they had made War againſt the Sheep, would admit of no accommodation, except upon theſe terms, that they ſhould deliver up the <hi>Dogs</hi> of the Flock; intending thereby, that the removal of theſe, ſhould make way for their quiet and ſecure preying upon the <hi>Flock.</hi> Every man may eaſily ſee how <hi>Mutato nomine, de his fabula narratur.</hi> Theſe grievous Wolves whoſe deſign is to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41777:112"/>prey upon the Flock, knowing full well that the Miniſtry is the greateſt defence of the Flock, and offence to them; cry out by all means to have theſe taken away that they might ſecurely prey upon the Flock, when none was left to oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence we ſee likewiſe what reaſon we have to be very thankful to God, for <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing</hi> and <hi>continuing</hi> this Office in the Church. That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>when he aſcended up on high, gave gifts to men to fit them for this work:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3.1.</note> that he hath <hi>held theſe Stars in his own right hand,</hi> mauger the Fanatick rage of erronious and illiterate miſcreants. It is eaſie to imagine, what an Egyptian <hi>darkneſs</hi> would have over-ſpread the face of our <hi>Church,</hi> if theſe <hi>Stars</hi> had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Let us therefore be thankful to him that hath upheld theſe, and that they ſtill <hi>ſhine</hi> amongſt us, both to ſhew us the right way to heaven, and to diſcover and ſhame the dark and abſurd Doctrines of men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and corrupt mindes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We learn hence, whereunto we that are employed in this honourable and weighty Office of the Miniſtry, ought to apply our ſelves, even to <hi>be instant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> both exhorting the people to the practifing of good Duties, and alſo <hi>convincing gain ſayers with ſuch ſpeech as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be gain-ſaid,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.9 &amp; 2.8.</note> that ſo thoſe that are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41777:113"/>contrarily minded may be aſhamed,</hi> and thoſe that are in the right may be encouraged to ſtand faſt in the Faith. And though men of unſound heads may eſteem this way of preaching to be galling and unpleaſant, yet it being our duty, we muſt not neglect it: And we ſhould the more be engaged to faithfulneſs, by conſidering thoſe that are committed to our charge; which leads me to the</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <note n="2" place="margin">Part.</note> Thing in the Text, the <hi>Subjects</hi> here ſpoken of, included in the <hi>Verb,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>(we be not).</hi> You ſhall ſeldom ſee Hereticks to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the ſeducing of lewd and <hi>prophane</hi> perſons: for they know that ſuch are a <hi>diſgrace</hi> to any Profeſſion or Cauſe, to which they adhere or wiſh well: But their great deſign is to pervert them <hi>that have in ſome meaſure eſcaped the pollution of the world,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.20.</note> through the knowledge of Chriſt:</hi> becauſe they are ſenſible that the ſame of the innocency and ſtrictneſs of the lives of thoſe that are retainers to their ways, will make men of good affections and weak judgements, to have the greater kindneſs for, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards their opinions. And indeed ſuch is the ſubtilty of theſe falſe Prophets, that, as our Saviour faith, <hi>They would deceive, if it were poſſible,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.24.</note> the very Elect.</hi> Now, theſe words of Chriſt, may give us a fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to enquire concerning theſe ſubjects <hi>(we)</hi> how far Gods <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Sanctified</hi> ones
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41777:113"/>may be led away with the <hi>errour</hi> of the wicked, ſo as to depart from their own ſtedfaſtneſs? In anſwer whereunto, I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is certain that ſuch ſhall never fall away to ſuch errours as will be <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> with Chriſtianity, and the holding of which would ſhew a man to have left that one <hi>Foundation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> beſides which no other can be laid. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that ſhould <hi>bring in damnable doctrines,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> even denying the Lord that bought them.</hi> Now we ſay, that none that ever had true Grace in his heart, ſhall be totally given over to ſuch errours, ſo as to live and dye in them. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed denyed his Maſter three times, but he was in a little while <hi>convinced</hi> of his ſin, <hi>and went forth and wept bitterly.</hi> But to perſiſt in errours of this Nature, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a ſtate of Grace. Though there are diverſities of <hi>Phyſiognomies</hi> amongſt men, yet all have the <hi>faces</hi> of men: And though true Chriſtians may have different thoughts about ſome points, yet they all hold faſt the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Chriſtianity. And this we may make uſe of</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To <hi>comfort</hi> us as to any of our Friends or thoſe whom we wiſh well unto, that are either enſnared, or in danger to be enſuared in errours. If they be ſuch as truly fear God, we may comfortably conclude, that <hi>though they fall, yet they ſhall riſe again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41777:114"/>the Lord upholdeth them with his hand.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.24. Luk. 21.31.</note> And <hi>Christ hath prayed for them,</hi> as he did for <hi>Peter, that their faith do not</hi> utterly <hi>fail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may ſhow us how to judge of them that are quite departed from the foundation of that Faith into which they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: even as the Apoſtle doth in the like caſe.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out from us, that it might be manifeſt that they were not of us.</hi>

Amongſt the ſons of men, there is ſuch <hi>variety</hi> of Features in their faces, that no two are in all points alike; and yet are all concluded under the general name of <hi>men.</hi> And amongſt the minds of men, there may be great variety in <hi>ſmaller</hi> matters, and yet while they hold faſt the <hi>foundation,</hi> we are not to exclude them from our <hi>charity,</hi> as if they were no Chriſtians.

                     <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by Faith; be not high minded but fear.</hi> We have heard, that even truly good men may fall into ſome errors; and we ſee by daily experience, that men of very high Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41777:114"/>and Attainments have fallen, and do daily fall. Now Pride and Careleſneſs, will put any of us into the way of falling, and therefore let us not be ſecure, nor <hi>lean to our own underſtandings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 3.5.</note> but truſt to the ſtrength of the Lord, who alone is able to hold us up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This ſhould teach us <hi>charity</hi> toward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeduced perſons. There are <hi>Seducers,</hi> and <hi>Seduced,</hi> amongſt the Sectaries.

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.10.</note> But when I became a man, I put away childiſh
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41777:115"/>things. Pueri mobiles ſunt, &amp; ſine judicio,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Meſander</hi> in locum.

                  <p n="1">1. Want of <hi>Conſideration.</hi> They do not take the pains to weigh what they hear, but

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Self-confidence.</hi> Young perſons are prone to conceit themſelves to know more then their Elders; and this confidence doth commonly overthrow them, while it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them from hearkning to the advice which elder years might adminiſter. And the Apoſtle tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.6.</note> that Novices in the Faith, are very apt to be <hi>pufft up with pride,</hi> and thereby <hi>to fall into the ſnare of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will greatly concern us therefore,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.13.</note> to take the Apoſtles Exhortation. <hi>Brethren, be not children in underſtanding: In malice be ye children, but in underſtanding be ye men.</hi> For to be children in Knowledge, will expoſe us

As a Ship in a tempeſtuous Sea is in great danger of ſhipwrack, and it is very doubtful whether ever it will ſafely arrive at its deſired haven: So theſe ſeduced perſons are in a very great and apparent danger of their ſouls; though the almighty power of God be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue them as a Lamb out of the mouth of a Lion, yet I ſay for the preſent they are in a condition of very great hazzard.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>original</hi> of them both. The Wind is conceived to be an Exhalation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing out of the Caverns of the Earth.
<note place="margin">Ariſt. 2.

                  <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them: the Wind is ſo leight and fluid a body, that it eſcapes our ſight, nor are we well able to tell what it is. Such are falſe doctrines, though they make a great <hi>noiſe</hi> and buſtle, ſo as to fill the world, as the Wind doth, yet are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (if well looked into) but <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>empty nothings,</hi> contending to appear as ſomething extraordinary to men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon apprehenſions.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41777:117"/>Metaphora, dum omnes hominum doctrinas,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Calvin in locum,</hi> It is an elegant Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, whereby the Apoſtle compares all the novel Doctrines of men to the Wind: for, as the Wind doth remove things from their places, and toſſeth them to and fro; ſo falſe doctrines do tend to <hi>unſettle</hi> us, and remove us from the Faith, whereas the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Word of Truth, is to <hi>root</hi> men and <hi>ſettle</hi> them in the Faith. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I may add, that as the Wind, though a leight and fluid body, yet hath a very great <hi>ſtrength</hi> and force in it: ſo falſe doctrines, though in themſelves lighter then vanity, yet are very <hi>powerful</hi> to amuſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle mens mindes from their former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41777:120"/>that they <hi>lie in wait</hi> meerly <hi>to deceive</hi> us: That ſo on whomſoever we ſee theſe Marks, we may know them ſo as to avoid them, and their deluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe that apply themſelves rather to <hi>perſwade</hi> the Affections, then to <hi>convince</hi> the Judgement. The Underſtanding was by God appointed to be the leader of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculties of the ſoul: whereas we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſay, that <hi>Love is blind,</hi> and the ſame we may ſay of <hi>Hatred,</hi> and all the reſt of the Affections; and conſequently the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ought firſt to be informed of the goodneſs or evil of any thing, before the Affections be ſet on, either to love or abhor it. And therefore we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they who attempt to win mens affections by perſwaſions, before they have convinced the judgment by weighty and cogent reaſons, doe take a very indirect courſe, <hi>to come in at the window and not at the door</hi> of the ſoul: And that either they are <hi>blind leaders of theſe blind</hi> affections; or elſe that, having more knowledge then honeſty themſelves, their deſigne is to impoſe upon the ſimple honeſty of well-meaning people. A way of <hi>popular oratory,</hi> mixed with plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and earneſt <hi>exclamations,</hi> and patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>obteſtations,</hi> is indeed very apt to prevail with men of <hi>lively affections,</hi> and <hi>dull under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings:</hi> But they that take ſuch courſes, may be ſuſpected as thoſe that intend

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If men wholly <hi>decry</hi> the judgment of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in matters of Religion, they afford us very ſtrong grounds to ſuſpect them. It is true, that many points of our Faith are ſo high, that they <hi>tranſcend</hi> the reach of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> onely we can ſee it reaſonable to receive thoſe points, upon the authority of the God of Truth, though our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings come ſhort of fathoming the <hi>depth</hi> of them: But we may ſpeak it for the honour of our Chriſtian Religion, that it preſents nothing to our Faith to be received, which is <hi>contrary</hi> to the principles of well-impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And therefore thoſe that have the face to tell us, that we muſt receive things from them, and from I know not what <hi>light within;</hi> and, if reaſon contradict it, we muſt lay it aſide as an humane and <hi>carnal</hi> buſineſs; yea, if a plain and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional interpretation of Scripture op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, we muſt reject that alſo as <hi>the Letter,</hi> and not <hi>the Spirit:</hi> What is this, but in plain terms to tell us, that they come on purpoſe to <hi>blindfold</hi> us, that they may lead us whither they liſt, and that it is but fit we ſhould ſubject our eyes to that cover they offer to put upon them.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41777:121"/>(if ever they be ſo) to brazen it out, and make the world to believe, that whoſoever oppoſeth them, muſt needs be in an <hi>error,</hi> they give us juſt occaſion to ſuſpect their <hi>deſigne.</hi> We have a great deal of talk in the world concerning Antichriſt, and what a dangerous Body he is: and as to the perſon or people that deſerve this name, we may ſay as Chriſt did of the true Chriſt, they ſhall ſay,

                     <hi>loe here is Chriſt, and loe there;</hi> many ſay, lo this is Antichriſt, and others cry, loe that is Antichriſt, till the vaineſt ſort of them have come to that paſs as to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is contrary to their own Way and Sect, to be <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> Now, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this as one of the moſt unreaſonable and dangerous Tenets that are profeſſed by the <hi>Roman Antichrist;</hi> then why ſhould we not reckon them to be of Antichriſtian ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that will not believe that it is <hi>poſſible</hi> they ſhould be deceived?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If men will <hi>uſurp</hi> the office of publick <hi>Teachers,</hi> and will not ſubmit themſelves to an orderly <hi>tryal</hi> by them that have judgment and authority to take an account of them, they give us juſt ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them as <hi>deceivers,</hi> inſtead of <hi>inſtructers</hi> of the ignorant.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41777:121"/>as this <hi>ſurly</hi> Tenet of refuſing to be ſubject to the trial and approbation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, doth at the firſt view, diſcover it ſelf to be the product of pride and <hi>height of ſtomach;</hi> ſo it is a ſigne, that theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have a deſigne to put off very bad <hi>wares</hi> to the people, ſeeing they will not ſuffer them to be brought to the <hi>light</hi> to be examined.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe that ſpend more time and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in preſſing men to embrace their <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> and opinions, then in exhorting them to the duties of <hi>holineſs</hi> towards God, and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> towards men, are very ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their proceedings.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41777:122"/>Apoſtles: But yet the conſtant judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of God in all Ages, concerning any point in <hi>controverſie,</hi> or concerning the meaning of any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Scripture,</hi> gives us good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to believe it, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe them that oppoſe it: becauſe it is not probable that our gracious God would leave his Church in the dark, through ſo many ages, and never diſcover the Truth till now of late.</p>

You have heard (1.) That there are many <hi>Winds</hi> of falſe doctrine ſtirring, to try who are ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. (2.) That Seducers uſe a great deal of <hi>ſubtilty</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> lying in wait to deceive. (3.) That a great number are by them <hi>toſſed to and fro, and carried about.</hi> (4.) That even thoſe that are of <hi>honest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> and <hi>good lives,</hi> are in danger of being enſnared by them; and therefore <hi>he that thinketh he ſtandeth, ſhould take heed leſt he fall.</hi> (5.) That eſpecially thoſe that are <hi>children,</hi> and weak in knowledge, are in great danger, and conſequently that we ſhould labour to be men and not <hi>children in understanding.</hi> (6.) Laſtly, that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Office of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> in the Church, as a ſpecial preſervation from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes they plead for a <hi>Reformation</hi> in matters of Religion, which if it were <hi>carried on</hi> as far as the ſhoulders of theſe great talkers would be able to bear it, yet would it not give ſatisfaction even to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41777:133"/>becauſe it is not done; whereas if theſe things were done, at leaſt ſome of theſe perſons would be the firſt to find themſelves agrieved therewith.

                  <p>Thus, I ſay, unquiet ſpirits will never want <hi>pretences</hi> to colour their turbulency: But theſe are meer pretences. What then ſhall we ſay of theſe men? Shall we ſay with <hi>David, Scatter O Lord,

                     </q> This ſmall Earthly-Globe is not wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their over-grown Fancies to buſtle in, and therefore they have added to it a New World in the <hi>Moon:</hi> To which yet they have not thus far attained, to ſet up a Poſt-office, that we might have ſome correſpondence with the people of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41777:139"/>thouſands of years before the world began.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and many other fancies in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, we may reaſonably believe to have proceeded rather from an humour to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the vulgar Opinions, and deſire to finde out ſomething New under the Sun, then that men did verily believe ſuch things to be ſo as they have attempted to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers believe.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the wantonneſs of mans wit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to vary in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> except they may have liberty to frame a new body of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> too. And ſure 'tis ſtrange, how ſome mens humours ſuit with diſputing and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing each other: Who doubtleſs would not embrace ſo many Paradoxes, were it not, that to be heterodox will gall other men, and make themſelves appear to be ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the world, by wearing a colour diſtinct from other men.</p>
                  <p>But we may ſay by too ſad experience, that <hi>Nimium altercando amittitur veritas,</hi> men have mudded theſe clear Cryſtalline ſtreams of Religion, by too much ſtirring in them, ſo that Truth can very hardly be diſcerned in the bottom. And indeed, <hi>Pruritus diſputandi ſcabies Eccleſiae,</hi> This itch of diſputing is one of the curſes of the Law ſent upon our Nation, for not keeping the Commandments of God: it hath taken off mens fingers from a zealous practiſing of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41777:139"/>good duties, to claw this itch of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while the life and power of Godlineſs hath been almoſt forgotten amongſt ſuch people. Yea, it hath opened the mouths of Papiſts, and men of Atheiſtical ſpirits, to reproach the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> if not all Religion, doubting whether there be any ſuch thing in reality, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it cannot agree about it.</p>
                  <p>It might have been a neceſſary act of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to have digreſſed here a little, to have <hi>fortified</hi> us againſt thoſe advantages that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> are apt to take againſt our Church, by reaſon of theſe diviſions: By telling the Atheiſt, that there were as great differences between the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and <hi>Academicks,</hi> as there are now amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: By telling the Papiſt, that the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between the <hi>Thomists</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Seculars,</hi> between the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> are not inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to thoſe which they ſee amongſt the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Beſides, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> (properly ſo called) is like <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, a City compact together;</hi> and as for thoſe that are turned aſide to dangerous Sects and Errors, we may ſay, <hi>They went out from us,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.19.</note> becauſe they were not of us.</hi> And I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer both Papiſts and Atheiſts, to that pious and learned Father, St. <hi>Augustine, de Civ. Dei. l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 51. where he ſheweth, how the

<note place="margin">Greg.

So the ſtrange auſterities and affected ſingularities of many of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people, it is to be feared, ariſe from no better ground. And yet, as the Poet ſaith of covetouſneſs,

Nor on the contrary is it ſufficient to <hi>ſwagger for Caeſar,</hi> if men be of prophane and lewd lives, or Atheiſts as to matters of Religion.
